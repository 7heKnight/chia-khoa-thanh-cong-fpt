Paradigms , last: | 6.2 Paradigms
Paradigms ,  | Within interaction design, a paradigm refers to a particular approach that has been adopted by the community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices. This follows from the way the term has been used in science to refer to a set of practices that a community has agreed upon, including:
Paradigms , last:. This follows from the way the term has been used in science to refer to a set of practices that a community has agreed upon, including: | The questions to be asked and how they should be framed.
Paradigms , last:. This follows from the way the term has been used in science to refer to a set of practices that a community has agreed upon, including: | The phenomena to be observed.
Paradigms , last:. This follows from the way the term has been used in science to refer to a set of practices that a community has agreed upon, including: | The phenomena to be observed.: The way findings from experiments are to be analyzed and interpreted (Kuhn, 1962).
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: In the 1980s, the prevailing paradigm in human?computer interaction was how to design user-centered applications for the desktop computer. Questions about what and how to design were framed in terms of specifying the requirements for a single ?euser?f interacting with a screen-based ?einterface.?f Task analytic and usability methods were developed based on an individual user's cognitive capabilities. The acronym WIMP was used as one way of characterizing the core features of an interface for a single user: this stood for Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointer. This was later superseded by the GUI (graphical user interface), a term that has stuck with us ever since.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: Within interaction design, many changes took place in the mid- to late 1990s. The WIMP interface with its single thread, discrete event dialog was considered to be unnecessarily limiting, e.g. Jacob, 1996. Instead, many argued that new frameworks, tools, and applications were needed to enable more flexible forms of interaction to take place, having a higher degree of interactivity and parallel input/output exchanges. At the same time, other kinds of non-WIMP interfaces were experimented with. The shift in thinking, together with technological advances, led to a new generation of user? computer environments, including virtual reality, multimedia, agent interfaces, pen-based interfaces, eye-movement-based interfaces, tangible interfaces, collaborative interfaces, and ubiquitous computing. The effect of moving interaction design ?ebeyond the desktop?f resulted in many new challenges, questions, and phenomena being considered. New methods of designing, modeling, and analyzing came to the fore. At the same time, new theories, concepts, and ideas entered the stage. A turn to the ?esocial,?f the ?eemotional,?f and the ?eenvironmental?f began shaping what was studied, how it was studied, and ultimately what was designed. Significantly, one of the main frames of reference?the single user?was replaced by a set of others, including people, places, and context.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: One of the most influential developments that took place was the birth of ubiquitous computing (Weiser, 1991) . A main idea was that the advent of ubiquitous computing (or ?eUbiComp?f as it is commonly known ) would radically change the way people think about and interact with computers. In particular, computers would be designed to be part of the environment, embedded in a variety of everyday objects, devices, and displays (see Figure 6.1) . The idea behind Weiser's vision was that a ubiquitous computing device would enter a person's center of attention when needed and move to the periphery of their attention when not, enabling the person to switch calmly and effortlessly between activities without having to figure out how to use a computer in performing their tasks. In essence, the technology would be unobtrusive and largely disappear into the background. People would be able to get on with their everyday and working lives, interacting with information and communicating and collaborating with others without being distracted or becoming frustrated with technology.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: The grand vision of ubiquitous computing has led to many new challenges, themes, and questions being articulated in interaction design and computer science. These include:
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: How to enable people to access and interact with information in their work, social, and everyday lives, using an assortment of technologies.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: How to design user experiences for people using interfaces that are part of the environment but where there are no obvious controlling devices.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: How and in what form to provide contextually-relevant information to people at appropriate times and places to support them while on the move.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: How to ensure that information that is passed around via interconnected displays, devices, and objects, is secure and trustworthy.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: The shift in thinking about ubiquitous computing has resulted in many new research and design activities and an extended vocabulary. Other terms, including pervasive computing, the disappearing computer, and ambient intelligence, have evolved that have different emphases and foci (we view them here as overlapping). In the next section, we describe the many new (and old) forms of interfaces that have been developed.
Four Key Issues , last:. These include: | 7.2 Four Key Issues
Four Key Issues ,  | Data gathering sessions need to be planned and executed carefully. Specific issues relating to the three data gathering techniques are discussed in the following sections, but first we consider four key issues that require attention for a data gathering session to be successful. These four issues are goal setting, the relationship between the data collector and the data provider, triangulation, and pilot studies.
Setting Goals , last:. These include: | 7.2.1 Setting Goals
Setting Goals ,  | The main reason for gathering data at all is to glean information about something. For example, you might want to understand how technology fits into normal family life, or you might want to identify which of two icons representing a ?esend email?f action is easier to use, or you might want to find out whether the redesign you are planning for a hand-held meter reader is along the right lines. There are many different reasons for gathering data, and before beginning it is important to identify specific goals for the particular study. The goals that are set will influence the nature of the data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and also the analysis to be performed. Once the goals have been set, then you can concentrate on what data to look for and what to do with it once it is gathered.
Setting Goals ,  | The goals may be expressed more or less formally, e.g. using some structured or even mathematical format, or using a simple description such as the ones in the previous paragraph, but whatever the format they should be clear and concise. In interaction design it is more usual to express the goals of data gathering more informally.
The Relationship with Participants , last:. These include: | 7.2.2 The Relationship with Participants
The Relationship with Participants ,  | One significant aspect of any data gathering is the relationship between the person (people) doing the gathering and the person (people) providing the data. Making sure that this relationship is clear and professional will help to clarify the nature of the study. One way in which this can be achieved is to ask participants to sign an informed consent form. The details of this form will vary, but it usually asks the participant to confirm that the purpose of the data gathering and how the data will be used has been explained to them and that they are happy to continue. It also often includes a statement that the participant may withdraw at any time, and that in this case none of their data will be used in the study.
The Relationship with Participants ,  | It is common practice in many countries to use an informed consent form when running evaluation sessions, particularly where the participants are members of the public, or are volunteers in a research project (see Box 13.2) . In this case, the informed consent form is intended to protect the interests of both the data gatherer and the data provider. The gatherer wants to know that the data she collects can be used in her analysis, presented to interested parties, and published in reports (as appropriate). The data provider wants reassurance that the information he gives will not be used for other purposes, or in any context that would be detrimental to him. This is especially true when disadvantaged groups such as disabled people or children are being interviewed. In the case of children, using an informed consent form reassures parents that their children will not be asked threatening, inappropriate, or embarrassing questions, or be asked to look at disturbing or violent images. In these cases, parents are asked to sign the form.
The Relationship with Participants ,  | However, this kind of consent is not generally required when collecting data for the requirements activity where a contract already exists in some form between the data collector and the data provider. For example, consider the situation where a consultant is hired to gather data from a company in order to establish a set of requirements for a new interactive system to support timesheet entry. The employees of this company would be the users of the system, and the consultant would therefore expect to have access to the employees to gather data about the timesheet activity. In addition, the company would expect its employees to cooperate in this exercise. In this case, there is already a contract in place which covers the data gathering activity, and therefore an informed consent form is less likely to be required. As with most ethical issues, the important thing is to consider the situation carefully and make a judgment based on the specific circumstances.
The Relationship with Participants ,  | Similarly, incentives for completing a questionnaire might be needed in some circumstances because there is no clear and direct advantage to the respondents, but in other circumstances, respondents may see it as part of their job to complete the questionnaire. For example, if the questionnaires form part of the requirements activity for a new mobile sales application to support sales executives, then it is likely that sales executives will complete a questionnaire about their job if they are told that the new device will impact on their day-to-day lives. In this case, the motivation for providing the required information is clear. However, if you are collecting data to understand how appealing is a new interactive website for school children, different incentives would be appropriate. Here, the advantage for the individuals to complete a questionnaire is not so obvious.
Triangulation , last:. These include: | 7.2.3 Triangulation
Triangulation ,  | Triangulation is a strategy that entails using more than one data gathering technique to tackle a goal, or using more than one data analysis approach on the same set of data. For example, using observation to understand the context of task performance, interviews to target specific user groups, questionnaires to reach a wider population, and focus groups to build a consensus view is one example of a triangulated data gathering program. Triangulation provides different perspectives and corroboration of findings across techniques, thus leading to more rigorous and defensible findings.
Pilot Studies , last:. These include: | 7.2.4 Pilot Studies
Pilot Studies ,  | A pilot study is a small trial run of the main study. The aim is to make sure that the proposed method is viable before embarking on the real study. Data gathering participants can be (and usually are) very unpredictable, even when a lot of time and effort has been spent carefully planning the data gathering session. Plans for a data gathering session should be tested by doing a pilot study before launching into the main study. For example, the equipment and instructions that are to be used can be checked, the questions for an interview or in a questionnaire can be tested for clarity, and an experimental procedure can be confirmed as viable. Potential problems can be identified in advance so that they can be corrected. Distributing 500 questionnaires and then being told that two of the questions were very confusing wastes time, annoys participants, and is an expensive error that could have been avoided by doing a pilot study.
Pilot Studies ,  | If it is difficult to find people to participate or if access to participants is limited, colleagues or peers can be asked to comment. Getting comments from peers is quick and inexpensive and can be a substitute for a pilot study. It is important to note that anyone involved in a pilot study cannot be involved in the main study. Why? Because they will know more about the study and this can distort the results.
Pilot Studies , last:. These include: | Box 7.1: Data versus information
Pilot Studies ,  | There is an important difference between data and information. Data is a collection of facts from which conclusions may be drawn, while information is the result of analyzing and interpreting the data. For example, you might want to know whether a particular screen structure has improved the user's understanding of the application. In this case, the data collected might include the time it takes for a set of users to perform a particular task, the users' comments regarding their use of the application, biometric data about the users' heart rate while using the application, and so on. At this stage, all you have is data. In order to get to information, the data needs to be analyzed and the results interpreted. That information can then feed into the requirements or evaluation activity.
Interviews , last:. These include: | 7.4 Interviews
Interviews ,  | Interviews can be thought of as a "conversation with a purpose" (Kahn and Cannell, 1957). How like an ordinary conversation the interview can be depends on the type of interview method used. There are four main types of interviews: open-ended or unstructured, structured, semi-structured, and group interviews ( Fontana and Frey, 1994). The first three types are named according to how much control the interviewer imposes on the conversation by following a predetermined set of questions. The fourth involves a small group guided by a facilitator.
Interviews ,  | The most appropriate approach to interviewing depends on the purpose of the interview, the questions to be addressed, and the stage in the lifecycle. For example, if the goal is to gain first impressions about how users react to a new design idea, such as an interactive sign, then an informal, open-ended interview is often the best approach. But if the goal is to get feedback about a particular design feature, such as the layout of a new web browser, then a structured interview or questionnaire is often better. This is because the goals and questions are more specific in the latter case.
Unstructured Interviews , last:. These include: | 7.4.1 Unstructured Interviews
Unstructured Interviews ,  | Open-ended or unstructured interviews are at one end of a spectrum of how much control the interviewer has over the interview process. They are exploratory and are more like conversations around a particular topic; they often go into considerable depth. Questions posed by the interviewer are open, meaning that there is no particular expectation about the format or content of answers. Open questions are used when you want to explore the range of opinions. For example, "What are the advantages of using a PDA?" Here, the interviewee is free to answer as fully or as briefly as she wishes and both interviewer and interviewee can steer the interview.
Unstructured Interviews ,  | It is always advisable to have a plan of the main topics to be covered. Going into an interview without an agenda should not be confused with being open to new information and ideas (see Section 7.4.5 on planning an interview). One of the skills necessary for conducting an unstructured interview is getting the balance right between making sure that answers to relevant questions are obtained, while at the same time being prepared to follow new lines of enquiry that were not anticipated.
Unstructured Interviews ,  | A benefit of unstructured interviews is that they generate rich data, i.e. data that gives a deep understanding of the topic, and is often interrelated and complex. In addition, interviewees may mention issues that the interviewer has not considered. But this benefit often comes at a cost. A lot of unstructured data is generated, which can be very time-consuming to analyze. It is also impossible to replicate the process, since each interview takes on its own format. Typically in interaction design, there is no attempt to analyze every interview in detail. Instead, the interviewer makes notes or audio records the session and then goes back through the data afterwards to note the main issues of interest.
Structured Interviews , last:. These include: | 7.4.2 Structured Interviews
Structured Interviews ,  | In structured interviews, the interviewer asks predetermined questions similar to those in a questionnaire (see Section 7.5) . Structured interviews are useful when the goals are clearly understood and specific questions can be identified. To work best, the questions need to be short and clearly worded. Typically the questions are closed, which means that they require an answer from a predetermined set of alternatives. Responses may involve selecting from a set of options that are read aloud or presented on paper. Closed questions work well for fast interviews when the range of answers is known, and where people tend to be in a rush. In a structured interview the same questions are used with each participant so the study is standardized. Example questions for a structured interview might be:
Structured Interviews ,  | Which of the following websites do you visit most frequently: amazon.com, barnes & noble.com, google.com, msn.com?
Structured Interviews ,  | How often do you visit this website: every day, once a week, once a month, less often than once a month?
Structured Interviews , last:. Example questions for a structured interview might be: | Have you ever purchased anything online?
Structured Interviews ,  | If so, how often do you purchase items online: every day, once a week, once a month, less often than once a month?
Structured Interviews ,  | Questions in a structured interview should be worded exactly the same for each participant, and they should be asked in the same order.
Semi-Structured Interviews , last:. Example questions for a structured interview might be: | 7.4.3 Semi-Structured Interviews
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | Semi-structured interviews combine features of structured and unstructured interviews and use both closed and open questions. For consistency the interviewer has a basic script for guidance, so that the same topics are covered with each interviewee. The interviewer starts with preplanned questions and then probes the interviewee to say more until no new relevant information is forthcoming. For example:
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | Which music websites do you visit most frequently? <Answer mentions several but stresses that she prefers hottestmusic.com
Semi-Structured Interviews , last:. For example: | Why? <Answer says that she likes the site layout>
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | Tell me more about the site layout <Silence, followed by an answer describing the site's navigation>
Semi-Structured Interviews , last:. For example: | Anything else that you like about the site? <Answer describes the animations>
Semi-Structured Interviews , last:. For example: | Thanks. Are there any other reasons for visiting this site so often that you haven't mentioned?
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | It is important not to pre-empt an answer by phrasing a question to suggest that a particular answer is expected. For example, "You seemed to like this use of color?c" assumes that this is the case and will probably encourage the interviewee to answer that this is true so as not to offend the interviewer. Children are particularly prone to behave in this way (see Box 7.2 for more on data gathering with children). The body language of the interviewer, for example, whether she is smiling, scowling, looking disapproving, etc., can have a strong influence on whether the interviewee will agree with a question.
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | Also, the interviewer needs to give the person time to speak and not move on too quickly. Probes are a device for getting more information, especially neutral probes such as, "Do you want to tell me anything else?" The person may also be prompted to help her along. For example, if the interviewee is talking about a computer interface but has forgotten the name of a key menu item, the interviewer might want to remind her so that the interview can proceed productively. Semi-structured interviews are intended to be broadly replicable, so probing and prompting should aim to help the interview along without introducing bias.
Semi-Structured Interviews , last:. For example: | Box 7.2: Working with children
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | Children think and react to situations differently from adults. Sitting a 4-year-old child down in a formal interview situation is unlikely to result in anything other than a wall of silence. If children are to be included in your data gathering sessions, then child-friendly methods are needed to make them feel at ease. For example, for very young children of pre-reading or early reading age, data gathering sessions need to rely on images and chat rather than written instructions or questionnaires. Read et al. (2002) have developed a set of ?esmileys?f for use with children in interviews (see Figure 7.1).
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | Recording children can also pose its problems. Children have a tendency to perform in front of a camera unless it is placed behind them, or they are given time to get used to it being there.
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | The appropriate techniques to involve children also depend on the goal of the data gathering session. For example, Guha et al. (2005) work with children as technology design partners. They focus on children between the ages of 7 and 11. They have found that unexpected innovations result when working as an inter-generational team, i.e. adults and children working together. The method they use is called cooperative inquiry (Druin, 2002) and is based on Scandinavian cooperative design practices, participatory design, and contextual inquiry. There are many techniques that can be used in cooperative inquiry, such as sketching ideas and brainstorming, and observational research which has been modified to accommodate children's preferred approaches. For example, the ?emixing ideas?f approach (which also works with younger children, aged 5 to 6) involves three stages. In the first stage, each child generates ideas, working one-on-one with an adult. In the second stage, groups of adults and children mix together these ideas. Finally, all the ideas are mixed together to form ?ethe big idea?f (see Figure 7.2). Guha et al.
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | report that they are currently developing technology reflecting concepts that emerged from the big idea.
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | In contrast, the Equator project investigated the use of new technology to encourage children to record and analyse aspects of the environment themselves. For example, Rogers et al. (2005) report on the Ambient Wood project which investigates the use of ubiquitous computing and mobile technologies to support learning. In this work, a learning experience was designed that encourages children to explore habitats in a woodland area. Each child was given a PDA and a mobile probing tool (see Figure 7.3) , which can collect data about their environment and send it to a central server. The data collected by the probe could be collated and displayed on the PDA in real time, thus giving immediate feedback to their investigations. The child's position was also monitored and location-specific data sent to their PDA, e.g.

Focus Groups , last:. For example: | 7.4.4 Focus Groups
Focus Groups ,  | Interviews are often conducted with one interviewer and one interviewee, but it is also common to interview people in groups. One form of group interview that is frequently used in marketing, political campaigning, and social sciences research is the focus group. Normally 3 to 10 people are involved, and the discussion is led by a trained facilitator. Participants are selected to provide a representative sample of the target population. For example, in an evaluation of a university website, a group of administrators, faculty, and students may form three separate focus groups because they use the web for different purposes. In requirements activities it is quite common to hold a focus group in order to identify conflicts in terminology or expectations from different sections within one department or organization.
Focus Groups ,  | The benefit of a focus group is that it allows diverse or sensitive issues to be raised that might otherwise be missed. The method assumes that individuals develop opinions within a social context by talking with others. Often questions posed to focus groups seem deceptively simple, but the idea is to enable people to put forward their own opinions in a supportive environment. A preset agenda is developed to guide the discussion, but there is sufficient flexibility for the facilitator to follow unanticipated issues as they are raised. The facilitator guides and prompts discussion and skillfully encourages quiet people to participate and stops verbose ones from dominating the discussion. The discussion is usually recorded for later analysis and participants may be invited to explain their comments more fully.
Focus Groups ,  | Focus groups can be very relaxed affairs (for the participants that is), but in some product development methods, focus groups have become very formalized. For example, the workshops (as they are called) used in Joint Application Development (Wood and Silver, 1995) are very structured, and their contents What users say isn't always what they do. When asked a question, people sometimes give the answers that they think show them in the best light, or they may just forget what happened or how long they spent on a particular activity. For example, in a study looking at the maintenance of telecommunications software, the developers stated that most of their job involved reading documentation, but when observed, it was found that searching and looking at source code was much more common than looking at documentation (Singer et al., 1997).
Focus Groups ,  | So, can interviewers believe all the responses they get? Are the respondents giving ?ethe truth?f or are they simply giving the answers that they think the interviewer wants to hear?
Focus Groups ,  | It isn't possible to avoid this behavior, but it is important to be aware of it and to reduce such biases by choosing questions carefully, getting a large number of participants or by using a combination of data gathering techniques.
Planning and Conducting an Intervi , last:. For example: | 7.4.5 Planning and Conducting an Interview
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Planning an interview involves developing the set of questions or topics to be covered, collating any documentation to give to the interviewee (such as consent form or project description), checking that recording equipment works in advance and you know how to use it, working out the structure of the interview, and organizing a suitable time and place.
Planning and Conducting an Intervi , last:. For example: | Developing Interview Questions
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Questions for an interview may be open or closed. Open questions are best suited to interviews where the goal of the session is exploratory. Closed questions require a list of possible answers, and so they can only be used in a situation where you know the possible answers in advance. It is always possible to have an ?eother?f option, but the ideal is that this option is not used very often. So whether you choose to use open questions or closed questions depends on what is already known about the topic of investigation and the goal of the interview. An unstructured interview will usually consist entirely of open questions, while a structured interview will usually consist of closed questions. A semi-structured interview may use a combination of both types.
Planning and Conducting an Intervi , last:. For example: | The following guidelines for developing interview questions are derived from Robson (2002):
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Compound sentences can be confusing, so split them into two separate questions. For example, instead of, "How do you like this cell phone compared with previous ones that you have owned?" Say, "How do you like this cell phone?" "Have you owned other cell phones?" If so, "How did you like it?" This is easier for the interviewee to respond to and easier for the interviewer to record.
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Interviewees may not understand jargon or complex language and might be too embarrassed to admit it, so explain them in layman's terms.
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Try to keep questions neutral, for example, if you ask "Why do you like this style of interaction?" this question assumes that the person does like it and will discourage some interviewees from stating their real feelings.
Planning and Conducting an Intervi , last:. For example: | Activity 7.2
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Activity 7.2: Cybelle (see Figure 7.4)  is an intelligent agent that guides visitors to the website Agentland which contains information about intelligent agents. As Cybelle is an intelligent agent, it is not straightforward to interact with her, and she can be frustrating. However, she remembers your name between visits, which is friendly.
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Activity 7.2: Cybelle has a variety of facial expressions and although the answers to my questions were often strange, she has an interesting approach to life, and one might almost say that she has personality! To see Cybelle in action, go to the website (http://www.agentland.com/)  and ask her some questions. You can ask any question you like, about intelligent agents, herself, or anything else. Alternatively, you can do this activity by just looking at the figure and thinking about the questions.

Other Forms of Interview , last:. Robson suggests the following steps for an interview: | 7.4.6 Other Forms of Interview
Other Forms of Interview ,  | Telephone interviews are a good way of interviewing people with whom you cannot meet. You cannot see their body language, but apart from this telephone interviews have much in common with face-to-face interviews.
Other Forms of Interview ,  | Online interviews, using either asynchronous communication such as email or synchronous communication such as instant messaging, can also be used. For interviews that involve sensitive issues, answering questions anonymously may be preferable to meeting face-to-face. If, however, face-to-face meetings are desirable but impossible because of geographical distance, video-conferencing systems can be used. Feedback about a product or a process can also be obtained from customer help lines, consumer groups, and online customer communities that provide help and support, e.g. see Box 9.2 on user involvement at Microsoft.
Other Forms of Interview ,  | At various stages of design, it is useful to get quick feedback from a few users through short interviews, which are often more like conversations, in which users are asked their opinions.
Other Forms of Interview ,  | Retrospective interviews, i.e. interviews which reflect on an activity that was performed in the recent past, are often conducted to check with participants that the interviewer has correctly understood what was happening.
Enriching the Interview Experience , last:. Robson suggests the following steps for an interview: | 7.4.7 Enriching the Interview Experience
Enriching the Interview Experience ,  | Interviews often take place in a neutral environment, e.g. a meeting room away from the interviewee's normal desk, and the interview situation provides an artificial context, i.e. separate from normal tasks. In these circumstances it can be difficult for interviewees to give full answers to the questions posed. To help combat this, interviews can be enriched by using props such as prototypes or work artifacts that the interviewee or interviewer brings along, or descriptions of common tasks (examples of these kinds of props are scenarios and prototypes, which are covered in Chapters 10 and 11) . These props can be used to provide context for the interviewees and help to ground the data in a real setting. Figure 7.5 illustrates the use of prototypes in a focus group setting.
Enriching the Interview Experience ,  | For example, Jones et al. (2004) used diaries as a basis for interviews. They performed a study to probe the extent to which certain places are associated with particular activities and information needs. Each participant was asked to keep a diary in which they entered information about where they were and what they were doing at 30 minute intervals. The interview questions were then based around their diary entries.
Questionnaires , last:. Robson suggests the following steps for an interview: | 7.5 Questionnaires
Questionnaires ,  | Questionnaires are a well-established technique for collecting demographic data and users' opinions. They are similar to interviews in that they can have closed or open questions. Effort and skill are needed to ensure that questions are clearly worded and the data collected can be analyzed efficiently. Clearly worded questions are particularly important when there is no researcher present to encourage the respondent and to resolve any ambiguities or misunderstandings. Well-designed questionnaires are good at getting answers to specific questions from a large group of people, and especially if that group of people is spread across a wide geographical area, making it infeasible to visit them all. Questionnaires can be used on their own or in conjunction with other methods to clarify or deepen understanding. For example, information obtained through interviews with a small selection of interviewees might be corroborated by sending a questionnaire to a wider group to confirm the conclusions. The methods and questions used depend on the context, target audience, data gathering goal, and so on.
Questionnaires ,  | The questions asked in a questionnaire, and those used in a structured interview, are similar, so how do you know when to use which technique? Essentially, the difference lies in the motivation of the respondent to answer the questions. If you think that this motivation is high enough to complete a questionnaire without anyone else present, then a questionnaire will be cheaper and easier to organize. On the other hand, if the respondents need some persuasion to answer the questions, it would be better to use an interview format and ask the questions face-to-face through a structured interview. For example, structured interviews are easier and quicker to conduct in situations in which people will not stop to complete a questionnaire, such as at a train station or while walking to their next meeting. One approach which lies between these two is the telephone interview.
Questionnaires ,  | It can be harder to develop good questionnaire questions compared with structured interview questions because the interviewer is not available to explain them or to clarify any ambiguities. Because of this, it is important that questions are specific; when possible, closed questions should be asked and a range of answers offered, including a ?eno opinion?f or ?enone of these?f option. Finally, negative questions can be confusing and may lead to the respondents giving false information. Some questionnaire designers use a mixture of negative and positive questions deliberately because it helps to check the users' intentions. In contrast, the designers of QUIS (Box 7.3) (Chin et al., 1988) decided not to mix negative and positive statements because the questionnaire was already complex enough without forcing participants to pay attention to the direction of the argument.
Questionnaires , last:. Robson suggests the following steps for an interview: | Box 7.3: QUIS, Questionnaire for user interaction satisfaction
Questionnaires ,  | The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS), developed by the University of Maryland Human?Computer Interaction Laboratory, is one of the most widely used questionnaires for evaluating interfaces (Chin et al., 1988; Shneiderman, 1998a). Although developed for evaluating user satisfaction, it is frequently applied to other aspects of interaction design. An advantage of this questionnaire is that it has gone through many cycles of refinement and has been used for hundreds of evaluation studies, so it is well tried and tested. The questionnaire consists of the following 12 parts that can be used in total or in parts:

Designing the Questionnaire's Stru ,  | Many questionnaires start by asking for basic demographic information, e.g. gender, age, place of birth, and details of relevant experience, e.g. the time or number of years spent using computers, or the level of expertise within the domain under study, etc. This background information is useful for putting the questionnaire responses into context. For example, if two respondents conflict, these different perspectives may be due to their level of experience?a group of people who are using the web for the first time are likely to express different opinions regarding websites to another group with five years of web experience. However, only contextual information that is relevant to the study goal needs to be collected. In the website example above, it is unlikely that the person's shoe size will provide relevant context to their responses!

Question and Response Format , last:. check the box to show) agreement or disagreement with the following statements: | 7.5.2 Question and Response Format
Question and Response Format ,  | There are several different types of question, each of which requires a particular kind of response. For example, closed questions require an answer from a set of possibilities while open questions are unrestricted. Sometimes many options can be chosen, sometimes respondents need to indicate only one, and sometimes it is better to ask users to locate their answer within a range. Selecting the most appropriate question and response format makes it easier for respondents to be able to answer clearly. Some commonly used formats are described below.
Question and Response Format , last:. check the box to show) agreement or disagreement with the following statements: | Check Boxes and Ranges
Question and Response Format ,  | Check Boxes and Ranges: The range of answers to demographic questionnaires is predictable. Gender, for example, has two options, male or female, so providing the two options and asking respondents to circle a response makes sense for collecting this information (as in Box 7.4) . A similar approach can be adopted if details of age are needed. But since some people do not like to give their exact age, many questionnaires ask respondents to specify their age as a range (see Box 7.4) . A common design error arises when the ranges overlap. For example, specifying two ranges as 15?20, 20?25 will cause confusion: which box do people who are 20 years old check? Making the ranges 14?19, 20?24 avoids this problem.
Question and Response Format ,  | Check Boxes and Ranges: A frequently asked question about ranges is whether the interval must be equal in all cases. The answer is that it depends on what you want to know. For example, if you want to collect information for the design of an e-commerce site to sell life insurance, the target population is going to be mostly people with jobs in the age range of, say, 21?65 years. You could, therefore, have just three ranges: under 21, 21?65, and over 65. In contrast, if you wanted to see how the population's political views varied across the generations, you might be interested in looking at 10-year cohort groups for people over 21, in which case the following ranges would be appropriate: under 21, 22?31, 32?41, etc.
Question and Response Format , last:. check the box to show) agreement or disagreement with the following statements: | Check Boxes and Ranges: Rating Scales
Question and Response Format ,  | Rating Scales: There are a number of different types of rating scales that can be used, each with its own purpose (see Oppenheim, 1992). Here we describe two commonly used scales, Likert and semantic differential scales. The purpose of these is to elicit a range of responses to a question that can be compared across respondents. They are good for getting people to make judgments about things, e.g. how easy, how usable, etc., and therefore are important for usability studies.
Question and Response Format ,  | Rating Scales: Likert scales rely on identifying a set of statements representing a range of possible opinions, while semantic differential scales rely on choosing pairs of words that represent the range of possible opinions. Likert scales are more commonly used because identifying suitable statements that respondents will understand is easier than identifying semantic pairs that respondents interpret as intended.
Question and Response Format ,  | Rating Scales: Likert scales. Likert scales are used for measuring opinions, attitudes, and beliefs, and consequently they are widely used for evaluating user satisfaction with products. For example, users' opinions about the use of color in a website could be evaluated with a Likert scale using a range of numbers, as in (1), or with words as in (2):
Question and Response Format , 1. The use of color is excellent (where 1 represents strongly agree and 5 represents strongly disagree): | 1. The use of color is excellent (where 1 represents strongly agree and 5 represents strongly disagree):
Question and Response Format , 1 	2 	3 	4 	5last:. The use of color is excellent (where 1 represents strongly agree and 5 represents strongly disagree): | 1 	2 	3 	4 	5
Question and Response Format , 1 	2 	3 	4 	5last:. The use of color is excellent (where 1 represents strongly agree and 5 represents strongly disagree): | ?? 	?? 	?? 	?? 	??
Question and Response Format , 1 	2 	3 	4 	5 | ?? 	?? 	?? 	?? 	??: In both cases, respondents could be given a box to tick as shown, or they could be asked to ring the appropriate number or phrase, in which case the boxes are not needed. Designing a Likert scale involves the following three steps:
Question and Response Format , 1.	Gather a pool of short statements about the subject to be investigated. For example, "This control panel is easy to use" or "The procedure for checking credit rating is too complex." A brainstorming session with peers in which you identify key aspects to be investigated is a good way of doing this. | 1.	Gather a pool of short statements about the subject to be investigated.

Question and Response Format , 3.	Select items for the final questionnaire and reword as necessary to make them clear. | Semantic differential scales. Semantic differential scales are used less frequently than Likert scales, possibly because it is harder to find pairs of words that can be interpreted consistently by participants. They explore a range of bipolar attitudes about a particular item. Each pair of attitudes is represented as a pair of adjectives. The participant is asked to place a cross in one of a number of positions between the two extremes to indicate agreement with the poles, as shown in Figure 7.6. The score for the evaluation is found by summing the scores for each bipolar pair. Scores can then be computed across groups of participants. Notice that in this example the poles are mixed so that good and bad features are distributed on the right and the left. In this example there are seven positions on the scale.

Question and Response Format , 3.	Select items for the final questionnaire and reword as necessary to make them clear. | Many questionnaires use seven- or five-point scales and there are also three-point scales. Arguments for the number of points go both ways. Advocates of long scales argue that they help to show discrimination, as advocated by the QUIS team (QUIS has a nine-point scale; Box 7.3 (Chin et al., 1988)). Rating features on an interface is more difficult for most people than, say, selecting among different flavors of ice cream, and when the task is difficult there is evidence to show that people ?ehedge their bets.?f Rather than selecting the poles of the scales if there is no right or wrong, respondents tend to select values nearer the center. The counter-argument is that people cannot be expected to discern accurately among points on a large scale, so any scale of more than five points is unnecessarily difficult to use.

Select items for the final questionnaire and reword as necessary to make them clear. | Another aspect to consider is whether the scale should have an even or odd number of points.

Administering Questionnaires , last:. For example: | 7.5.3 Administering Questionnaires
Administering Questionnaires ,  | Two important issues when using questionnaires are reaching a representative sample of participants and ensuring a reasonable response rate. For large surveys, potential respondents need to be selected using a sampling technique. However, interaction designers commonly use small numbers of participants, often fewer than 20 users. 100% completion rates are often achieved with these small samples, but with larger or more remote populations, ensuring that surveys are returned is a well-known problem. 40% return is generally acceptable for many surveys, but much lower rates are common. Depending on your audience you might want to consider offering incentives (see Section 7.2.2).
Online Questionnaires , last:. For example: | 7.5.4 Online Questionnaires
Online Questionnaires ,  | Online questionnaires are becoming increasingly common because they are effective for reaching large numbers of people quickly and easily. There are two types: email and web-based. The main advantage of email is that you can target specific users. But unless email is just used to contact potential respondents and point them to a web-based questionnaire, an email questionnaire is likely to be simply an electronic editable version of a paper-based questionnaire, and this loses some of the advantages you get with a web-based questionnaire. For example, a web-based questionnaire can be interactive and can include check boxes, pull-down and pop-up menus, help screens, and graphics, e.g. Figure 7.8. It can also provide immediate data validation and can enforce rules such as select only one response, or certain types of answers such as numerical, which cannot be done in email or with paper. Other advantages of web-based questionnaires include faster response rates and automatic transfer of responses into a database for analysis (Andrews et al., 2003).
Online Questionnaires ,  | The main problem with web-based questionnaires is obtaining a random sample of respondents. As there is no central registry of Internet users, it is not possible to identify the size and demography of the full population being surveyed, and traditional sampling methods cannot be used. This means that the respondents are inevitably self-selecting and so the results cannot be generalized to offline populations. This was a criticism of the survey run by Georgia Tech's GVU (Graphic, Visualization and Usability)
Online Questionnaires ,  | Centre, one of the first online surveys. This survey collected demographic and activity information from
Online Questionnaires ,  | Internet users twice yearly between January 1994 and October 1998. The policy that GVU employed to deal with this difficult sampling issue was to make as many people aware of the GVU survey as possible so that a wide variety of participants were encouraged to respond. However, even these efforts did not avoid biased sampling, since participants were still self-selecting.
Online Questionnaires ,  | Some survey experts instead propose using national census records to sample offline (Nie and Ebring, 2000) . The highly regarded PEW surveys select households to poll using random digit samples of telephone numbers, but these are telephone surveys and an equivalently reliable sampling method has not yet been suggested for online surveys. In some countries, web- and mobile phone-based questions are used in conjunction with television to elicit viewers' opinions of programs and political events, e.g. the television program Big Brother. A term that is gaining popularity is convenience sampling, which is another way of saying that the sample includes those who were available rather than those selected using scientific sampling.

If so, why? There has been much research examining how people respond to surveys when using a computer compared with the traditional paper and pencil method. Some studies suggest that people are more revealing and consistent in their responses when using a computer to report their habits and behaviors, such as eating, drinking, and amount of exercise, e.g. Luce et al. (2003). Students have also been found to rate their instructors less favorably when online, suggesting they are more honest in their views of their instructors (Chang, 2004). One reason for this is that students may feel less social pressure when filling in a questionnaire at a computer and hence freer to write the truth than when sitting in a classroom, with others around them, filling out a paper-based version.

This may be achieved in four stages: the survey is reviewed by knowledgeable analysts; typical participants complete the survey using a think-aloud protocol (see below); a small version of the study is attempted; a final check to catch small errors is conducted. | Comment: Another factor that can influence how people answer questions is the way the information is structured on the screen or page, such as the use of headers, the ordering, and the placement of questions. But the potential may be greater for web-based questionnaires since they provide more opportunities than paper ones for manipulating information (Smyth et al., 2004). For example, the use of dropdown menus, radio buttons, and jump-to options may influence how people read and navigate a questionnaire. Research is beginning to investigate how such interactivity affects respondents' behavior when thinking about their replies; for example, Smyth et al. (2005) have found that providing forced choice formats results in more options being selected. The initial findings suggest that instead of prescribing a generic design format for all web-based questionnaires, e.g. using only radio buttons or entry check boxes, that the design should be selected based on the purpose of the questionnaire and the types of questions being asked (Gunn,
Simple Qualitative Analysis , last:., 2003): | 8.4 Simple Qualitative Analysis
Simple Qualitative Analysis ,  | As with quantitative analysis, the first step in qualitative analysis is to gain an overall impression of the data and to start looking for patterns. Some patterns will have emerged during the data gathering itself, and so you may already have some idea of the kinds of pattern to look for, but it is important to confirm and re-confirm findings to make sure that initial impressions are not biasing analysis. For observation data, the guiding framework will have given some structure to the data. For example, the framework for observation from Goetz and LeCompte (1984) introduced in Chapter 7, will have resulted in a focus on questions such as "Who is present," "What is happening" and "Where is it happening." Using this framework you may notice that when someone from the accounts department comes to the administration office to meet staff members, then there is a lot of interest and everyone from the office attends the meeting. However, when visitors from other departments come to the administration office, or when accounts meetings are held in the accounts office, there is less interest. Using Robson's framework, patterns relating to physical objects, people's goals, sequences of events, and so on are likely to emerge.
Simple Qualitative Analysis ,  | There are three simple types of qualitative analysis that we discuss here: identifying recurring patterns and themes, categorizing data, and analyzing critical incidents. These are not mutually exclusive and can each be used with the others.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  , last:., 2003): | 8.4.1 Identifying Recurring Patterns or Themes
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | As you become more familiar with the data, recurring themes or patterns will emerge. An example is noticing that most senior managers interviewed express frustration at the lack of up-to-date information they have from the marketing department.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Nearly all data analysis begins with identifying patterns or themes. This is true when working with quantitative and qualitative data. Sometimes the patterns or themes form the primary set of findings for the analysis and sometimes they are just the starting point for more detailed investigation of the data. Patterns in quantitative data may be identified through graphical representation (as discussed above), but identifying themes in qualitative data requires the researcher to be immersed in the data. Themes emerge and evolve over this time.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The study goals provide an orienting focus for the formulation of themes. For example, consider a survey to evaluate whether the information displayed on a train travel website is adequate and sufficient. Several of the respondents add comments to the survey suggesting that, as well as the origin and destination stations, the station stops in between should also be displayed. This is a theme relevant to the study goals and would be reported as a main theme. In another part of the survey, under ?efurther comments?f you might notice that several respondents comment that the company's logo is distracting. Although this too is a theme in the data, it is not directly relevant to the study's goals and may be reported only as a minor theme.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | One aspect of this form of analysis is to keep clear and consistent records of what has been found, and a close description of themes or patterns that are emerging. If the description is not specific enough then you may end up with a set of observations that do not address the goals. If the description is too specific then you may find that you have lots of themes, each with only one or two pieces of evidence.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Studying the data, focusing on the study goals, and keeping clear records of the analysis as it progresses are important. Box 8.4 and Case study 8.1 describe studies where themes have been identified from qualitative data and reported as a significant part of their results. The results in Box 8.4 were arrived at by immersion in the data; the box for Case study 8.1 illustrates the use of a specific technique for ordering data?the affinity diagram.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Note that patterns and themes in your data may relate to a variety of aspects: to behavior, to your user group, to places or situations where certain events happen, and so on. Each of these kinds of theme may be relevant to your goals. For example, descriptions of typical users (personas) may be an outcome of data analysis that focuses on patterns of participant characteristics.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  , last:., 2003): | Box 8.4: Themes in European culture
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Bell (2001) reports on ethnographic research in Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Spain that focused on European culture. She and her team visited 45 households from small towns, cities, and major metropolitan centers. The aim of the study was to understand what people do and don't do in their homes, how a household relates to the wider community, what technologies were present, and how they were used. The work they conducted informed the design of existing products and pointed to new product opportunities such as computing in public spaces.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The researchers used an approach which allowed them to track important cultural values?in each country they started by visiting a small town, then moved to a city, and then to a larger metropolitan area. In this way, they could initially understand the daily rhythm of life in the country in a manageable context before moving to the more complex situations. They assumed that any patterns which were observed in all three different contexts were likely to be significant. Taking an ethnographic stance, the researchers tried to do everything that native people would normally do. They followed people around and asked lots of questions about what life was like and what people do. Four significant themes (called ?edomains?f by the researchers) were identified from this work: togetherness, media experiences, consumption habits, and life outside of the home.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Togetherness. Family, kinship, and community were found to be very significant in Europe. For example, the importance of the family eating together was a recurrent theme in the interviews and in the team's observations. Other occasions also promote social gatherings, such as sporting events and leisure activities. The researchers noted that sometimes people spend time together simply watching television. They found an emphasis on face-to-face social time throughout their studies, and the willingness of people to expend effort to maintain this ?etogetherness.?f
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Media experiences. The researchers found that many different kinds of media play a variety of roles in European life? both consumption and production of content. For example, they found people painting, playing musical instruments, sketching and drawing in nearly every population center they visited.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Television and print media also play an important role. Television is talked about explicitly by European families for its educational role. The researchers found print media of various kinds (magazines, newspapers, catalogues, pricelists, etc.) in the European homes they visited, and also observed rituals of reading and use of these materials, for example buying more than one daily newspaper in order to gain different perspectives on the news articles.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Consumption habits. "Food shopping is a really important part of daily life in most European countries." Europeans frequent a wide variety of shops and have a distinct preference for very fresh food. The openair market is a particularly important part of French daily life, and the preparation, cooking, and consumption of the food is highly valued. In addition to purchasing items, shopping is also a social activity which connects people to their communities.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Life outside of the home. The researchers were struck by the variety of spaces outside the home where people socialized, and by the diversity of behaviors they observed. For example, people talk, flirt, play games, admire, create art, listen to music, eat, dance, swim, walk, and ?ehang out?f in gardens, parks, bars, pubs, cafes, promenades, markets, boulevards, and plazas. How often people frequent these places, and what they do there, changes with age and life stage.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  , last:., 2003): | Case Study 8.1: Using ethnographic data to understand Indian ATM usage
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | This case study focuses on an investigation into the use of ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) in Mumbai, India. It illustrates the use of ethnographic data to answer questions such as: "What is the general attitude towards ATMs use?" and "What problems do people face when using ATMs?"
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The project involved data collection through field observations and semi-structured interviews with early ATM adopters, bank customers who do not use the ATM, and customers who used the ATM for the first time during this study. Over 40 interviews were recorded, and photographs and videos were taken where possible. In addition, user profiles representing six different social classes were generated. Together with observations of ATM usage the project collected a considerable amount of data.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The project's use of affinity diagrams to help analyze the information that they collected is described by De Angeli et al. (2004). The affinity diagram (see Figure 8.9 for an example) which is used in contextual design (Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1998) aims to organize individual ideas and insights into a hierarchy showing common structures and themes. Notes are grouped together because they are similar in some fashion. The groups are not predefined, but must emerge from the data. The process was originally introduced into the software quality community from Japan, where it is regarded as one of the seven quality processes. The affinity diagram is built by a process of induction. One note is put up first, and then the team searches for other notes that are related in some way.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The affinity diagram organized the insights, ideas, and cultural influences gathered during the interviews and observations into a set of 10 top-level categories including perceptions of ATMs, banking habits, what people do while waiting in banks, and social and language barriers to banking (see Figure 8.10) . Using the affinity diagram technique also highlighted some opposite behaviors. For example, two women who both wanted to avoid temptation ( that of spending too much money) had different attitudes to the

Categorizing Data , last:., 2003): | 8.4.2 Categorizing Data
Categorizing Data ,  | Transcripts of meetings, interviews, or think-aloud protocols can be analyzed at a high level of detail, such as identifying stories or themes, or at a fine level of detail in which each word, phrase, utterance, or gesture is analyzed. Either way, elements identified in the data are usually categorized first using a categorization scheme. The categorization scheme may arise from the data itself, if the investigation is exploratory, as it might be in the requirements activity, or it might originate elsewhere in a well-recognized categorization scheme, or a combination of these two approaches may be used. The principle here is that the data is divided up into elements and each element is then categorized.
Categorizing Data ,  | Which categories to use is largely determined by the goal of the study. One of its most challenging aspects is determining meaningful categories that are orthogonal?i.e. do not overlap each other in any way. Another is deciding on the appropriate granularity for the categories, e.g. at word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph level; this is also dependent on the goal of the study and the data being analyzed.
Categorizing Data ,  | The categorization scheme used must be reliable so that the analysis can be replicated. This can be demonstrated by training a second person to use the categories. When training is complete, both people analyze the same data sample. If there is a large discrepancy between the two analyses, either training was inadequate or the categorization is not working and needs to be refined. Talking to those applying the categorization scheme can determine the source of the problem, which is usually with the categorization. If so, then the categorization scheme needs to be revised and re-tested. However, if the individuals do not seem to know how to carry out the process then they probably need more training.
Categorizing Data ,  | When a high level of reliability is reached, it can be quantified by calculating the inter-rater reliability. This is the percentage of agreement between the two researchers, defined as the number of items that both people categorized in the same way, expressed as a percentage of the total number of items examined. It provides a measure of the efficacy of the technique and the rigor of the category definition.
Categorizing Data ,  | To illustrate categorization, we present an example derived from a set of studies looking at the use of different navigation aids in an online educational setting (Armitage, U. 2004). These studies involved observing users working through some online educational material (about evaluation methods), using the think-aloud technique. The think-aloud protocol was recorded and then transcribed before being analyzed from various perspectives, one of which was to identify usability problems that the participants were having with the online environment (Nestor Navigator, Zeiliger et al. (1997)). An excerpt from the transcription is shown in Figure 8.11.

However, where a significant set of data cannot be categorized, the scheme can be extended. In this case the categorization scheme and the categorization itself develop in parallel, with the scheme evolving as more analysis is done.
participant makes a suggestion f ,  | Having categorized the data, the results can be used to answer the study goals. In the example above, the study allowed the researchers to be able to quantify the number of usability problems encountered overall by participants, the mean number of problems per participant for each of the test conditions, and the number of unique problems of each type per participant. This also helped to identify patterns of behavior and recurring problems. Having the think-aloud protocol meant that the overall view of the usability problems could take context into account.

participant makes a suggestion f ,  | Comment: The example above used a form of content analysis. Content analysis typically involves categorizing the data and then studying the frequency of category occurrences. For example, Maria Ebling and Bonnie John (2000) developed a hierarchical content classification for analyzing data when evaluating a graphical interface for a distributed file system.
participant makes a suggestion f ,  | Comment: An informal version of content analysis is often used as the first stage in identifying software objects from descriptions of the domain. In this approach, nouns and verbs are identified and scrutinized to see if they represent significant classes.
participant makes a suggestion f ,  | Comment: Another way of analyzing a transcript is to use discourse analysis. Discourse analysis focuses on the dialog, i.e. the meaning of what is said, and how words are used to convey meaning. Discourse analysis is strongly interpretive, pays great attention to context, and views language not only as reflecting psychological and social aspects but also as constructing it (Coyle, 1995). An underlying assumption of discourse analysis is that there is no objective scientific truth. Language is a form of social reality that is open to interpretation from different perspectives. In this sense, the underlying philosophy of discourse analysis is similar to that of ethnography. Language is viewed as a constructive tool and discourse analysis provides a way of focusing upon how people use language to construct versions of their worlds ( Fiske,  1994).

participant makes a suggestion f ,  | Comment: Conversation analysis is a very fine-grained form of discourse analysis. In conversation analysis the semantics of the discourse are examined in fine detail, and the focus is on how conversations are conducted. This technique is used in sociological studies and examines how conversations start, how turn-taking is structured, and other rules of conversation. This analysis technique has been used to analyze interactions on the Internet, e.g. in chatrooms, bulletin boards, and virtual worlds, and has started to influence designers' understanding about users' needs in these environments. It can also be used to compare conversations that take place through different media, e.g. face-to-face versus email.
Looking for Critical Incidents , last:. Our coded extract is below: | 8.4.3 Looking for Critical Incidents
Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | Data gathering sessions for interaction design usually result in a lot of data. Analyzing all of that data in any detail would be very time-consuming, and is often not necessary. We have already suggested that themes, patterns and categories can be used to identify areas where detailed analysis is appropriate. Another approach is to use the ?ecritical incident technique.?f
Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | The critical incident technique is a flexible set of principles that emerged from work carried out in the United States Army Air Forces where the goal was to identify the critical requirements of ?egood?f and ?ebad?f performance by pilots (Flanagan, 1954). It has two basic principles: "(a) reporting facts regarding behaviour is preferable to the collection of interpretations, ratings and opinions based on general impressions; (b) reporting should be limited to those behaviours which, according to competent observers, make a significant contribution to the activity" (Flanagan, 1954, p. 355). In the interaction design context, the use of well-planned observation sessions as discussed in Chapter 7 satisfies the first principle. The second principle is referring to critical incidents, i.e. incidents which are significant or pivotal to the activity being observed, in either a desirable or an undesirable way.
Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | In interaction design, critical incident analysis has been used in a variety of ways, but the main focus is to identify specific incidents that are significant, and then to focus on these and analyze them in detail, using the rest of the data collected as context to inform their interpretation. These may be identified by the users, through a retrospective discussion of a recent event, or they may be identified by an observer either through studying video footage, or from observation of the event in real time. For example, in an evaluation study a critical incident may be signalled by times when users were obviously stuck?usually marked by a comment, silence, looks of puzzlement, etc. Jurgen Koenemann-Belliveau et al. (1994) used this approach to compare the efficacy of two versions of a Smalltalk programming manual for supporting novice programmers. They examined breakdowns or problems in achieving a programming task and identified possible threats of incidents, and they were able to trace through a sequence of incidents and achieve a more holistic understanding of the problem. For example, they found that they needed to emphasize how objects interact in teaching object-oriented programming.
Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | Another example is reported in Curzon et al. (2002). They identified a set of critical incidents through field trials of an in-car navigation device. One example incident in this context was "On one journey, the system gave directions to turn right when the destination was to the left. Its route was to go round the block to go in the other direction. A car following ignored this turn and went the more obvious way, arriving first."

For example, following a critical incident analysis, themes may be identified around the circumstances that caused the incident to occur, and then discourse analysis may be conducted to understand the detail. Analyzing video material brings its own challenges; we address video analysis in Box 8.5.

Looking for Critical Incidents , 3.	When trying to book the cinema tickets by phone she discovered that she needed a credit card which she doesn't have, and so she had to give me the phone! | One approach to analyzing video data is interaction analysis (IA), outlined by Jordan and Henderson (1995) . They describe it as an in-depth microanalysis of how people interact with one another, their physical environment, and the documents, artifacts, and technologies in that environment. A focus is on the patterns and anomalies in people's routine interactions and the events that unfold throughout time. These are described in terms of the turns people take in talking and physical actions they perform, e.g. writing. The approach also looks to see if there are seamless transitions between events, e.g. handovers between shift workers, or there is some awkwardness or something does not happen, e.g. one shift worker forgets to pass on information to another. Other approaches to analyzing and interpreting video data are distributed cognition and grounded theory, covered in Section 8.5. Here, again, the emphasis is on revealing phenomena that are important to an ongoing activity. Ethnographically and anthropologically informed analyses of human and social conduct in work, home, and everyday spaces are also popular, e.g. Heath and Luff (1994).
Looking for Critical Incidents , 3.	When trying to book the cinema tickets by phone she discovered that she needed a credit card which she doesn't have, and so she had to give me the phone! | A good way to start a video analysis is to watch what has been recorded all the way through while writing a high-level narrative of what happens, noting down where in the video there are any potentially interesting events. How you decide which is an interesting event will depend on what is being observed. For example, if you are studying the interruptions that occur in an open plan office, you would include each time a person breaks off from an ongoing activity, e.g. phone rings, someone walks into their cubicle, email arrives. If it is a study of how pairs of students use a collaborative learning tool then activities such as turn-taking, sharing of input device/s, speaking over one another, and ?efighting?f over shared objects would be appropriate to record.

These may not be the same, since videotape can run at different speeds to real time. Labels for certain routine events are also used, e.g. lunchtime, coffee break, staff meeting, doctor's round. Spreadsheets are used to record the classification and description of events, together with annotations and notes of how the events began, how they unfold, and how they end.

There are various logging and screen capture tools, e.g. Camtasia or SnagIt, available for this purpose that enable you to play back the interactions as a movie, showing screen objects being opened, moved, selected, and so on. These can then be played in parallel with the video to provide different perspectives on the talk, physical interactions, and the system's responses that occur. Having a combination of data streams can enable more detailed and fine-grained patterns of behavior to be interpreted.
Using Theoretical Frameworks , last:. When I asked my daughter to attempt this task, I noticed several critical incidents including the following: | 8.6 Using Theoretical Frameworks
Using Theoretical Frameworks ,  | Structuring the analysis of qualitative data around a theoretical framework can lead to additional insights that go beyond the results found from the simple techniques introduced earlier. This approach also relies less on the study goals to focus analysis. However, these frameworks are quite sophisticated and using them requires investment to make sure that the framework is understood and applied appropriately. This section discusses three frameworks that are commonly used in interaction design to structure the analysis of data gathered in the field, such as ethnographic data: grounded theory, distributed cognition, and activity theory.
Grounded Theory , last:. When I asked my daughter to attempt this task, I noticed several critical incidents including the following: | 8.6.1 Grounded Theory
Grounded Theory ,  | Grounded theory is an approach to qualitative data analysis that aims to develop theory from the systematic analysis and interpretation of empirical data, i.e. the theory derived is grounded in the data. The approach was originally developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and since has been adopted by several researchers, with some adaptations to different circumstances. In particular, Glaser and Strauss have individually (and with others) developed the theory in slightly different ways, but the aim of this approach remains the same. Glaser (1992) provides further information about the differences and areas of controversy.
Grounded Theory ,  | The aim of grounded theory is to develop a theory that fits a set of collected data. By ?etheory?f is meant in this context: "a set of well-developed concepts related through statements of relationship, which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used to explain or predict phenomena" (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). Development of a ?egrounded?f theory progresses through alternating data collection and data analysis: first data is collected and analyzed to identify categories, then that analysis leads to the need for further data collection, which is analyzed, and more data is then collected. Data gathering is hence driven by the emerging theory. This approach continues until no new insights emerge and the theory is well-developed. During this process, the researcher needs to maintain a balance between objectivity and sensitivity. Objectivity is needed to maintain accurate and impartial interpretation of events; sensitivity is required to notice the subtleties in the data and identify relationships between concepts.
Grounded Theory ,  | The thrust of the analysis undertaken is to identify and define the properties and dimensions of relevant categories and then to use these as the basis for constructing a theory. Category identification and definition is achieved by ?ecoding?f the data, i.e. marking it up according to the emerging categories. According to Strauss and Corbin (1998), this coding has three aspects, which are iteratively performed through the cycle of data collection and analysis:
Grounded Theory ,  | i.	Open coding. Open coding is the process through which categories, their properties, and dimensions are discovered in the data. This process is similar to our discussion of categorization above, including the question of granularity of coding (at the word, line, sentence, conversation level, etc.).
Grounded Theory ,  | ii.	Axial coding. Axial coding is the process of systematically fleshing out categories and relating them to their subcategories.
Grounded Theory ,  | iii.	Selective coding. Selective coding is the process of refining and integrating categories to form a larger theoretical scheme. The categories are organized around one central category that forms the backbone of the theory. Initially, the theory will contain only an outline of the categories but as more data is collected, they are refined and developed further.
Grounded Theory ,  | Grounded theory says little about what data collection techniques should be used, but focuses instead on the analysis. Strauss and Corbin (1998) encourage the use of written records of analysis and diagrammatic representations of categories (which they call memos and diagrams). These memos and diagrams evolve as data analysis progresses. The following analytic tools are used to help stimulate the analyst's thinking and identify and characterize relevant categories:
Grounded Theory ,  | The use of questioning (not questioning your participants, but questioning the data): questions can help an analyst to generate ideas or consider different ways of looking at the data. It can be useful to ask questions when analysis appears to be in a rut.
Grounded Theory ,  | Analysis of a word, phrase, or sentence: considering in detail the meaning of an utterance can also help to trigger different perspectives on the data.
Grounded Theory ,  | Further analysis through comparisons: comparisons may be made between objects or between abstract categories. In either case, comparing one with the other brings alternative interpretations. Sharp et al. (2005) take this idea further and use metaphor as an analysis technique with qualitative data.
Grounded Theory ,  | One of the things that distinguishes a grounded theory approach to data gathering and analysis from ethnographic approaches is that researchers are encouraged to draw on their own theoretical backgrounds to help inform the study, provided that they are alert to the possibility of unintentional bias.

Grounded Theory ,  | Sarker et al. (2001) used the grounded theory approach to develop a model of collaboration in virtual teams. The virtual teams used in the study were made up of students from two universities?one in Canada and one in the United States of America. Each team consisted of four to five members from each university. Each team was given the task of studying a business systems problem, producing a systems design for it, and developing a working prototype. The projects themselves lasted about 14 weeks and a total of 12 teams participated in the study. The team members could communicate directly with each other using various technologies such as email, videoconferencing, telephone, and fax. The main communication channel, however, was Webboard, a collaborative message board tool supporting threaded discussions, email discussions, chat rooms, instant messaging, calendar, whiteboard, blogging, and so on. Using Webboard meant that communication was more public, and could be recorded more easily.
Grounded Theory ,  | All communication data through Webboard was automatically saved, minutes of any videoconferences, telephone calls, or Internet chat sessions undertaken were posted on Webboard, and the team members were also asked to provide any additional emails they received or sent to other team members. In addition to this data, the team's final project reports, individual team members' reflections on the lessons learned through the project, feedback on fellow team members' performance, and comments on the virtual project itself were all collected and used as data for the study.
Grounded Theory ,  | As soon as the teams were formed, informal data analysis began and two of the researchers became participant observers in the project teams, developing sensitivity to the project and its goals. They also began to reflect on their own backgrounds to see what theoretical frameworks they could draw on.
Grounded Theory ,  | Open coding. This was done initially on a line-by-line basis, but later coding was done at the message level, while other documents such as reports and reflections were coded at document level. Over 200 categories were generated, and as these were refined, some informal axial coding was also done. Table 8.5 shows two messages posted at the beginning of a project, and illustrates how these messages were

Grounded Theory , 6. 	Novelty of technology, recognizing the need to try/explore. | Sarker et al. note that codes emerged and continued to be refined over the life of the project. Also, a significant number of the codes that were ultimately used in the theory building were recurrent, for example, preference for technology and time gaps/boundaries. Finally, some of the key categories were identified when considering messages as one unit and looking at comparable strips in other data segments.

Grounded Theory , 1.	The major categories, e.g. technology, norms, social practices, stages of team development, and frames of reference, were hierarchically related to subcategories. For example, the category technology was linked to the subcategories purpose of technology, nature of ownership, accessibility (by time, location, cost, awareness), future potential, degree of novelty, and interconnectedness. At the next level, purpose of technology was linked to information sharing, triggering, and so on (see Figure 8.14) . During this process, the researchers returned to open coding and refined categories further. | 1.

Using these two approaches, the category ?estages of team development?f was chosen as the core category for the grounded theory to be built from this data set, and other categories were linked around it. This theory was further elaborated upon through discussions and reading of theory, and evolved into a theory of how virtual teams develop over time.

They studied the introduction and use of digital libraries in four settings over a fouryear period, collecting data from a total of 144 users. Focus groups and interviews were the primary data collection techniques. They concluded that where technology is integrated with the communities and their practice, through an information intermediary, perceptions of empowerment were increased; where technology is deployed within communities, yet with poor design and support, technologies were perceived as complex and threatening; and where technology was designed in isolation from the communities, users were either unaware of the technology or perceived it as complex or threatening.

This qualitative approach was used to explore the issues before moving on to develop more detailed questions, but their conclusions included suggested design modifications to take this perspective on security into account.
Distributed Cognition , last:. They instead used a two-step process for axial coding: | 8.6.2 Distributed Cognition
Distributed Cognition ,  | We introduced the distributed cognition approach in Chapter 3, as a theoretical account of the distributed nature of cognitive phenomena across individuals, artifacts, and internal and external representations ( Hutchins, 1995). Here, we illustrate how to conduct a distributed cognition analysis by providing a worked example.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Typically, a distributed cognition analysis results in an event-driven description which emphasizes information and its propagation through the cognitive system under study. The cognitive system under study might be one person's use of a computational tool, such as a calculator; two people's joint activities when designing the layout for the front page of a newspaper, using a shared authoring tool, or more widely, a large team of software developers and programmers, examining how they coordinate their work with one another, using a variety of mediating artifacts, such as schedules, clocks, to-do lists, and shared files.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The granularity of analysis varies depending on the activities and cognitive system being observed and the research or design questions being asked. For example, if the goal is to examine how a team of pilots fly a plane?with a view to improving communication between them?then the focus will be on the interactions and communications that take place between them and their instruments, at a fine level of granularity. If the goal is to understand how pilots learn how to fly?with a view to developing new training materials?then the focus will be at a coarser grain of analysis, taking into account the cultural, historical, and learning aspects involved in becoming a pilot.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The description produced may cover a period of a day, an hour, or only minutes, depending on the study's focus. For the longer periods, verbal descriptions are primarily used. For the shorter periods, micro-level analyses of the cognitive processes are meticulously plotted using diagrammatic forms and other graphical representations. The rationale for performing the finer levels of analysis is to reveal practices and discrepancies that would go unnoticed using coarser grains of analysis, but which reveal themselves as critical to the work activity.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Ed Hutchins emphasizes that an important part of doing a distributed cognition analysis is to have a deep understanding of the work domain that is being studied. He even recommends, where possible, that the investigators take steps to learn ?ethe trade?f under study and become an accomplished pilot or sailor (as he has done himself in both cases). This can take a team of researchers several months and even years to accomplish and in most cases this is impractical for a research or design team to do.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Alternatively, it is possible to spend a few weeks immersed in the culture and setting of a specific team to learn enough about the organization and its work practices to conduct a focused analysis of a particular cognitive system. For example, I spent six weeks with an engineering team, where I was able to learn enough about their work practice to gain a good understanding of how they worked together on projects, how they coordinated their work with each other, and how the technologies that were used mediated their work activities. I was then able to document and analyze a number of problems they were experiencing through the introduction of new networking technology. Using the distributed cognition framework, I described how seemingly simple communication problems led to large delays and recommended how the situation could be improved (Rogers, 1993, 1994).
Distributed Cognition , last:. They instead used a two-step process for axial coding: | Performing a Distributed Cognition Analysis
Distributed Cognition ,  | It should be stressed that there is not one single way of doing a distributed cognition analysis, nor is there an off-the-shelf manual that can be followed. A good way to begin analyzing and interpreting the data collected is to describe the official work practices, in terms of the routines and procedures followed, and the workarounds that teams develop when coping with the various demands placed upon them at different times during their work. In so doing, any breakdowns, incidents, or unusual happenings should be highlighted, especially where it was discovered that excessive time was being spent doing something, errors were made using a system, or a piece of information was passed on incorrectly to someone else or misheard. While writing these observations down it is good to start posing specific research questions related to them, e.g. "Why did X not let Y know the printer was broken when he came back from his break?" and to contemplate further, e.g. "Was it a communication failure, a problem with being overloaded at the time, or a technology problem?"
Distributed Cognition ,  | It is at this point that knowledge of the theory of distributed cognition can help in interpreting and representing the observations of a work setting (see Chapter 3 and Hutchins, 1995). It provides an analytic framework and a set of concepts to describe what is happening at a higher level of abstraction. Problems can be described in terms of the communication pathways that are being hindered or the breakdowns arising due to information not propagating effectively from one representational state to another (see Box 8.7) . The framework can reveal where information is being ?edistorted,?f resulting in poor communication or inefficiency. Conversely, it can show when different technologies and the representations displayed via them are effective at mediating certain work activities and how well they are coordinated.
Distributed Cognition , last:. They instead used a two-step process for axial coding: | Box 8.7: Distributed cognition concepts
Distributed Cognition ,  | A distributed cognition analysis involves producing a detailed description of the domain area at varying levels of granularity. At the micro-level, a small set of cognitive terms are used to depict the representations employed in a cognitive activity and the processes acting upon them. The terms are intended to steer the analysis towards conceptualizing problems in terms of distributed information and representations. This level of description can also directly lead to recommendations, suggesting how to change or redesign an aspect of the cognitive system, such as a display or a socially mediated practice. The main terms used are:
Distributed Cognition ,  | The cognitive system? the interactions among people, the artifacts they use, and the environment they are working in.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The communicative pathways? the channels by which information is passed between people, e.g. phone, email, physical gesture.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Propagation of representational states? how information is transformed across different media. Media refers to external artifacts (e.g. instruments, maps, paper notes) and internal representations (e.g. human memory). These can be socially mediated (e.g. passing on a message verbally), technologically mediated ( e.g. pressing a key on a computer), or mentally mediated (e.g. reading the time on a clock ).
Distributed Cognition , last:. The main terms used are: | An Example of Applying the Distributed Cognition Approach: Call Centers
Distributed Cognition ,  | Ackermann and Halverson's research (Ackermann and Halverson, 2000; Halverson, 2002) has used the distributed cognition framework to understand, at a cognitive level, how call centers work. Call centers have greatly increased during the last 10 years?now fronting many organizations, including banks, computer companies, postal services, and government offices. Their main function is to field phonebased queries, offering help and advice to customers about their products, services, etc.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The aim of Ackermann and Halverson's study was to find out how the operators of a typical call center manage the fast-paced and information-intensive process they are engaged in and, in particular, how they answer queries and what information resources they use to achieve this. Their study lasted 18 months, where they collected large amounts of data, including observations, videos, and semi-structured interviews. From their assortment of data, they initially described the domain area and what the phone operators do to accomplish their work. They also noted the unusual demands placed upon the operators and the methods and workarounds they used.
Distributed Cognition ,  | One of the first things they noted is that call center operators are under a lot of pressure. They need to begin forming their answers within 45?60 seconds of answering a call. This can be very demanding, given the diversity of questions that can be asked and the round-about way of talking some callers adopt. However, they also observed that many of the queries the operators encounter are similar, enabling the operators to classify them into types and develop ?eroutines?f for finding the information needed for a given type. At a finer level of analysis, Ackermann and Halverson decided to focus on the routines. They observed over 300 calls, taped 60 of them, and chose to analyze 10 in detail. The 10 were transcribed, covering the actions taken and the conversations that took place. One example of ?eJoan?f is used in their write up of the study to illustrate what is involved in a typical routine.
Distributed Cognition ,  | To begin, they drew a schematic bird's eye view of Joan's workplace, illustrating the physical set-up (see Figure 8.16) . The figure shows how the different workspaces are related to each other and the various resources that are used during calls. What stands out immediately from the figure is the way the resources are spread out, requiring Joan to walk from her desk to a shared table for every call. While keeping her fit, it also reveals that certain types of information have to be ?ecarried?f between the different locations.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The representations and technologies that are used at Joan's desk and elsewhere are then described. These include software applications, monitors, the telephone, manuals, lists, scraps of paper, and post-it notes. The way that incoming calls are handled is also highlighted: pointing out how the telephone system allocates incoming calls to the next available operator.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The type of call that is then analyzed is one of the most common, which in this call center concerns employment verification. Ackermann and Halverson describe a specific example that is representative of many others. A caller (a mortgage lender) wishes to find out whether one of its customers is actually employed by Company X and so calls the call center to verify this. Joan, who receives the call, looks up this information using a database (EMPLOY) that can only be accessed at the shared terminal that is 3 meters away from her desk. For every call she has to disconnect her headset from the phone, and walk to the central table to access the database to find out the information needed. In addition, Joan has to enter a record for every call using a computer-based tracking system (CAT) that is accessed via the terminal on her desk. When she answers the call, she has at the same time to close out the one she was previously working on. While doing this, she asks the caller for details about the person in question. This she types into the new record (the overlapping of tasks is noted by the analysts as being significant). Joan then writes this down on a piece of paper. The reason for this duplication of the same information is that she needs to carry it over to the EMPLOY system. The information (including a social security number) is too much to remember and would be easy to get mixed up or forgotten while walking over to the other terminal. She walks over to the EMPLOY system with the piece of paper and copies the information into the software, to enable her to get the new information she needs. She writes this down on the same piece of paper. She then returns to her desk and relays this new piece of information back to the caller, while completing the details of the call in the record on the CAT system (the overlapping of tasks at this stage is noted by the analysts as also being significant).
Distributed Cognition ,  | Having described the seemingly simple task in prose, Halverson and Ackermann re-represent the short sequence of events in a diagrammatic form, making explicit how the various media support the way the information is propagated across different representational states. The diagram reveals the different cognitive memories that are used during the various transformations (see Figure 8.17) , including Joan's and the caller's, indicating how they are transformed from working memory to long-term memory. Importantly, by representing this common routine using the notation, nine different memories were revealed as being involved in the propagation of representational states. This is a large number and shows how the routine task is far from simple, involving a complex set of overlapping steps.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Through examining the diagram and revisiting their textual descriptions, Ackermann and Halverson were able to reflect upon the implications of the many overlapping tasks Joan has to accomplish, some simultaneously. They subsequently performed an even finer grain of analysis, examining how the multiple memories are interleaved at a physical level, noting the actual physical movements involved in each change in representation state, e.g. when Joan moved and clicked the mouse, alongside what was said at that point. Another notation was used for this purpose.
Distributed Cognition , last:. The main terms used are: | How Useful is Distributed Cognition?
Distributed Cognition ,  | What is gained from conducting a detailed distributed cognition analysis such as this one? To a manager or outsider, the routine call would appear to involve a simple request and yet Ackermann and Halverson's analysis reveals it to be a complex cognitive task. An outcome of performing their micro-level analysis was to make explicit the nature of the complexity: showing how memories are distributed and interwoven; sometimes they belong to an individual, e.g. Joan's note written down on a piece of paper, and other times they are part of the system, e.g. the call handling procedure embedded in the telephone system. Furthermore, it describes systematically how a piece of information is propagated through multiple representational states, being verbally, physically, and mentally transformed, that has implications for the redesign of the supporting systems. It identifies the cognitive workload that is involved when different resources have to be used and coordinated for the same task.
Distributed Cognition ,  | What are the design implications? Simply enabling the EMPLOY database to be accessed at the same terminal as the CAT system would seem like an obvious solution. However, the information still needs to be propagated between applications and the cutting and pasting editing functions may not be compatible between the different applications. Moreover, the operator may be put under even more pressure to complete a call in even less time, if it is perceived that the operators no longer have to walk anywhere to access information resources. However, this perspective does not take into account the amount of cognitive effort required to access and enter information via different information systems.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Performing a detailed distributed cognition analysis enables researchers and designers to explore the trade-offs and likely outcomes of potential solutions and in so doing suggest a more grounded set of cognitive requirements, e.g. types of information resources, that are considered suitable for specific kinds of activities. Clearly, such a painstaking level of analysis and the expertise required in the interpretation is very costly. In the commercial world, where deadlines and budgets are always looming, it is unlikely to be practical. However, in large-scale and safety critical projects, where more time and resources are available, it can be a valuable analytic tool to use.
Activity Theory , last:. The main terms used are: | 8.6.3 Activity Theory
Activity Theory ,  | Activity theory (AT) is a product of Soviet psychology that explains human behavior in terms of our practical activity with the world. It originated as part of the attempt to produce a Marxist psychology, an enterprise usually associated with Vygotsky (e.g. 1926/1962) and later Leontiev (e.g. 1978, 1989). In the last 20?30 years, versions of AT have become popular elsewhere, particularly in Scandinavia, Germany, and now growing in the USA and UK. The newer ?eversions?f of AT have been popular in research investigating ?eapplied?f problems, particularly those to do with work, technology, and education.
Activity Theory ,  | Activity theory provides a framework that focuses analysis around the concept of an ?eactivity?f and helps to identify tensions between the different elements of the system. For example, Wendy Mackay et al. (2000) analyzed a 4-minute excerpt from a video of users working with a new software tool. They identified 19 shifts in attention between different parts of the tool interface and the task at hand. In fact, some users spent so much time engaged in these shifts that they lost track of their original task. Using the theory helped evaluators to focus on relevant incidents.
Activity Theory ,  | AT outlines two key models: one which outlines what constitutes an ?eactivity?f and one which models the mediating role of artifacts.
Activity Theory , last:. The main terms used are: | The Individual Model
Activity Theory ,  | The Individual Model: AT models activities in a hierarchical way. At the bottom level are ?eoperations,?f routinized behaviors that require little conscious attention, e.g. rapid typing. At an intermediate level are ?eactions,?f behavior that is characterized by conscious planning, e.g. producing a glossary. The top level is the activity, and that provides a minimum meaningful context for understanding the individual actions, e.g. writing an essay (see Figure 8.18) . There may be many different operations capable of fulfilling an action, and many actions capable of serving the same activity.
Activity Theory , last:. The main terms used are: | The Individual Model: Figure 8.18: The original activity theory model
Activity Theory ,  | The Individual Model: Activities can be identified on the basis of the motives that elicit them, actions on the basis of conscious goals that guide them, and operations by the conditions necessary to attain the goals. However, there is an intimate and fluid link between levels. Actions can become operations as they become more automatic and operations can become actions when an operation encounters an obstacle, thus requiring conscious planning. Similarly there is no strict demarcation between action and activity. If ?emotive?f changes then an activity can become an action. It is also important to realize that activities are not self-contained. Activities relate to others while actions may be part of different activities, and so on.
Activity Theory , last:. The main terms used are: | The Individual Model: The Role of Artifacts
Activity Theory ,  | The Role of Artifacts: Artifacts can be physical, such as a book or a stone, or they can be abstract, such as a system of symbols or a set of rules. Physical artifacts have physical properties that cause humans to respond to them as direct objects to be acted upon. They also embody a set of social practices, their design reflecting a history of particular use. Leontiev describes the process of learning what these inherent properties are as one of ?eappropriation,?f signifying the active nature of the learning that is needed. The kind of learning involved is one of identifying and participating in the activity appropriate to the artifact. Consider an infant learning to feed with a spoon. Leontiev (1981) observed that, at first, the infant carries the spoon to its mouth as though it were handling any other object, not considering the need to hold it horizontal. Over time, with adult guidance, the spoon is shaped in the way it is because of the social practice?the activity?of feeding and, in turn, the infant's task is to learn that relationship?to discover what practice(s) the object embodies. By contrast a spoon dropped into the cage of a mouse, say, will only ever have the status of just another physical object?no different from that of a stone.
Activity Theory ,  | The Role of Artifacts: The idea of abstract artifacts follows from the idea of ?emediation,?f i.e. a fundamental characteristic of human development is the change from a direct mode of acting on the world to one that is mediated by something else. In AT, the artifacts involved in an activity mediate between the elements of it.
Activity Theory ,  | The Role of Artifacts: AT also emphasizes the social context of an activity. Even when apparently working alone, an individual is still engaged in activities that are given meaning by a wider set of practices.
Activity Theory ,  | The Role of Artifacts: The classic view of an activity has a subject (who performs the activity) and an object (on which the activity is performed). Recent developments in AT, particularly by Engestrom (e.g. 1999) and Nardi (e.g.

The conceptual model (Figure 8.18)  is the main framework that is used to describe levels within an activity. This means that identifying elements will be highly dependent on individual interpretation. Christiansen (1996, p. 177) summarizes: "Methodologically?c the ideal data for an application of AT consist of longitudinal ethnographic observation, interviews and discussion in real-life settings, supplemented by experiments." She continues that you "cannot interview people directly through rote questions but must interpret their actions and opinions after some careful reflection," which is a difficult process. Nevertheless, the original and later versions of the AT framework have become popular amongst researchers and some practitioners as a way of identifying needs for new tools and to analyze problems that are present in a work or other setting.

In Figure 8.20, completing a software project is considered to be a top-level activity, while programming a module as an action. However, equally, programming a module could be viewed as an activity?if that was the object of the subject (person).

The version of AT they used was the popular Engestrom one (Figure 8.19) . The domain chosen overlaps with the call center analyzed using the distributed cognition approach. We have selected these two projects on purpose to show the different emphases between the two approaches.

This was seen in the wider context of knowledge management?a concept that has received much attention in recent years. The primary method of data collection was through interview: 32 employees were interviewed for one to one-and-a-half hours each. The interviews were transcribed and documented with notes and artifacts produced by the interviewees during the conversation. These were then annotated in terms of particular elements of the activity system, e.g. rules, object. Examples of subjects were frontline and backline engineers who deal with the calls; examples of tools were a knowledge repository tool with documented answers and the computer network used to run it on.

A lot of times I summarize it or if I can get another call while I am finishing up this call ?c if another one is coming, I'll answer the phone and start working on it.

What is Involved in Interaction Desi , 3.	The first thing that came into my head when I started doing this was the myriad of resources I currently use to plan my travel. For example, travel agents will arrange accommodation, visas, guided tours, etc., for me; I can look at paper-based or electronic timetables for journey routes and times, ring up automated timetable readers, operators who will give me travel advice, embassies who will also give me travel advice about their own country, websites to identify cheap flights, and so on. There is a long list. I then thought it would be good to combine the advantages of all of these into one system that could then be tailored to me. For example, so that the first airline offered for any flights is my favorite airline, and the starting point for my journeys is defaulted to my normal train station or airport. The next thing I focused on was the dialog I would have with the system. Hence, my sketches focus on questions the system might ask me and my responses. One of the things that occurred to me as I was producing this sketch is that the location I need to enter will depend on the kind of transport I choose, and the kind of help I need will also depend on the kind of transport I want to use. On the other hand, I would want the system to know that I am unlikely to want to drive in my car to Hong Kong, which is several thousand miles away, so it should automatically default to travel by air for some destinations, and similarly if there is no airport near a destination then it should know that I would not want to fly. | 3.

On the other hand, I would want the system to know that I am unlikely to want to drive in my car to Hong Kong, which is several thousand miles away, so it should automatically default to travel by air for some destinations, and similarly if there is no airport near a destination then it should know that I would not want to fly.

However, if I was planning travel for a holiday I am more likely to want pictures of the destination and descriptions of local activities, restaurants, historic sites, and so on. I might also want to enter my choices in a different way, focusing on the kind of holiday or location I want to travel to, and leaving the system to suggest alternatives. This led me to reconsider (although not redraw) my ideas.

In this activity, you may have started by thinking about what you would like such a system to do for you, or you may, like me, have been thinking about existing resources. Sketching something, or writing down concrete lines, squiggles, and words, helps to focus the mind on what you are designing, the details of the interaction, and the kinds of interaction your design will support. All the time you were doing this, you will have been making choices between alternatives, exploring your requirements in more detail, and refining your ideas about what you would like a travel organizer to do for you.

Interaction design also involves these activities, and in addition we focus attention very clearly on users and their goals. For example, we investigate the artifact's use and target domain by taking a user-centered approach to development, we seek users' opinions and reactions to early designs, and we involve users appropriately in the development process itself. This means that users' concerns direct the development rather than just technical concerns, and for interaction design, the three fundamental activities of design listed above are extended to include an activity of producing a version of the design that users can interact with.

But design is also about trade-offs, about balancing conflicting requirements. One common form of trade-off when developing a system to offer advice is deciding how much choice will be given to the user and how much direction the system should offer. Often the division will depend on the purpose of the system, e.g. for business travel or for holiday travel. Getting the balance right requires experience, but it also requires the development and evaluation of alternative solutions.

As Linus Pauling once said: "The best way to get a good idea, is to get lots of ideas." This is not necessarily easy, however, and unlike many design disciplines, interaction designers are not generally trained to generate alternative designs. The good news is that the ability to brainstorm and contribute alternative ideas can be learned. For example, Kelley (2001) describes seven secrets for better brainstorms, including sharpen the focus (have a well-honed problem statement), playful rules (to encourage ideas), and get physical (use visual props). He also discusses six ways to kill a brainstorm, including do it off-site and write everything down. Danis and Boies (2000) found that using techniques from graphic design that encouraged the generation of alternative designs stimulated innovative interactive systems design.

This requires the design to be captured and expressed in some suitable form that allows review, revision, and improvement. There are many ways of doing this, one of the simplest being to produce a series of sketches. Other common approaches are to write a description in natural language, to draw a series of diagrams, and to build prototypes. A combination of these techniques is likely to be the most effective. When users are involved, capturing and expressing a design in a suitable format is especially important since they are unlikely to understand jargon or specialist notations. In fact, a form that users can interact with is most effective, and building prototypes of one form or another (see Chapter 11) is an extremely powerful approach (see Box 9.1).

I was on a course designed to introduce new graduates to different possible careers in industry. One of the themes was production and manufacturing and the aim of one group exercise was to produce a notebook. Each group was told that it had 30 minutes to deliver 10 books to the person in charge. Groups were given various pieces of paper, scissors, sticky tape, staples, etc., and told to organize ourselves as best we could. So my group set to work organizing ourselves into a production line, with one of us cutting up the paper, another stapling the pages together, another sealing the binding with the sticky tape, and so on. One person was even in charge of quality assurance. It took us less than 10 minutes to produce the 10 books, and we rushed off with our delivery. When we showed the person in charge, he replied, "That's not what I wanted, I need it bigger than that." Of course, the size of the notebook wasn't specified in the description of the task, so we found out how big he wanted it, got some more materials, and scooted back to produce 10  more books. Again, we set up our production line and produced 10 books to the correct size. On delivery we were again told that it was not what was required: he wanted the binding to work the other way around. This time we got as many of the requirements as we could and went back, developed one book, and took that back for further feedback and refinement before producing the 10 required.

The Importance of Involving Users , last:. Using these as discussion points, the team were able to suggest specific improvements to the knowledge management tool being developed, including: | 9.2.1 The Importance of Involving Users
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | The description above emphasizes the need to involve users in interaction design, but why is it important? In the past, developers would often talk to managers or to ?eproxy users,?f i.e. people who roleplayed as users, when eliciting requirements. While a proxy user can provide useful information, they will not have the same perspective as someone who performs the task every day, or who will use the intended product on a regular basis. For example, several years ago, I was involved with a system to process and record financial transactions from the foreign exchange (?eforex?f) dealers in a large international bank. The users of this system took the handwritten transaction records completed by the ?eforex?f dealers and entered the details into the system. The system then validated the transaction and communicated a confirmation to the relevant parties. When the requirements for this system were developed, no-one from the development team spoke to the end-users of the system; the requirements were identified by higher-level managers. Although the system was successfully used to support the task, the end-users had developed several ?ework-arounds.?f For example, the system required both buyer code and buyer name to be entered, but it was quite common for the dealers to write only the buyer name on their transaction chitty. It would have been simple to design the system to support entry of transactions based on names or codes, but this wasn't done?both fields were required. This wasted a lot of time as the users had to identify the codes manually.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | The best way to ensure that development continues to take users' activities into account is to involve real users throughout development. In this way, developers can gain a better understanding of users' goals, leading to a more appropriate, more usable product. However, two other aspects that have nothing to do with functionality are equally as important if the product is to be usable and used: expectation management and ownership.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | Expectation management is the process of making sure that the users' views and expectations of the new product are realistic. The purpose of expectation management is to ensure that there are no surprises for users when the product arrives. If users feel they have been ?echeated?f by promises that have not been fulfilled, then this will cause resistance and maybe rejection. Expectation management is relevant whether you are dealing with an organization introducing a new software system or a company developing a new interactive toy. In both cases, the marketing of the new arrival must be careful not to misrepresent the product. How many times have you seen an advert for something you thought would be really good to have, but when you see one, discover that the marketing ?ehype?f was a little exaggerated? I expect you felt quite disappointed and let down. Well, this is the kind of feeling that expectation management tries to avoid.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | It is better to exceed users' expectations than to fall below them. This does not mean just adding more features, however, but that the product supports the users' goals more effectively than they expect. Involving users throughout development helps with expectation management because they can see from an early stage what the product's capabilities are and what they are not. They will also understand better how it will affect their jobs and lives, and what they can expect to do with the product; they are less likely to be disappointed. Users can also see the capabilities develop and understand, at least to some extent, why the features are the way they are.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | Adequate and timely training is another technique for managing expectations. If you give people the chance to work with the product before it is released, either by training them on the real system or by offering hands-on demonstrations of a pre-release version, then they will understand better what to expect when the final product is released.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | A second reason for user involvement is ownership. Users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product's development are more likely to feel a sense of ?eownership?f towards it and be receptive to it when it finally emerges.
Degrees of User Involvement , last:. Using these as discussion points, the team were able to suggest specific improvements to the knowledge management tool being developed, including: | 9.2.2 Degrees of User Involvement
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Different degrees of user involvement may be implemented in order to manage expectations and to create a feeling of ownership. At one end of the spectrum, users may be co-opted to the design team so that they are major contributors. For any one user, this may be on a full-time basis or a part-time basis, and it may be for the duration of the project or for a limited time only. There are advantages and disadvantages to each situation. If a user is co-opted full-time for the whole project, their input will be consistent and they will become very familiar with the system and its rationale. However, if the project takes many years they may lose touch with the rest of the user group, making their input less valuable. If a user is co-opted part-time for the whole project, she will offer consistent input to development while remaining in touch with other users. Depending on the situation, this will need careful management as the user will be trying to learn new jargon and handle unfamiliar material as a member of the design team, yet concurrently trying to fulfill the demands of their original job. This can become very stressful for the individuals. If a number of users from each user group are co-opted part-time for a limited period, input is not necessarily consistent across the whole project, but careful coordination between users can alleviate this problem. In this case, one user may be part of the design team for six months, then another takes over for the next six months, and so on.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | At the other end of the spectrum, users may be kept informed through regular newsletters or other channels of communication. Provided they are given a chance to feed into the development process through workshops or similar events, this can be an effective approach to expectation management and ownership. In a situation with hundreds or even thousands of users it would not be feasible to involve them all as members of the team, and so this might be the only viable option.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | If a large number of users is available, then a compromise situation is probably the best. Representatives from each user group may be co-opted onto the team on a full-time basis, while other users are involved through design workshops, evaluation sessions, and other data-gathering activities.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | The individual circumstances of the particular project affect what is realistic and appropriate. If your enduser groups are identifiable, e.g. you are developing a product for a particular company, then it is easier to involve them. If, however, you are developing a product for the open market, it is unlikely that you will be able to co-opt a user to your design team, and so an alternative approach is needed. For example, Box 9.2 explains how Microsoft involves users in its developments.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | One of the reasons often cited for not involving users in development is the amount of time it takes to organize, manage, and control such involvement. This issue may appear particularly acute in developing systems to run on the Internet, where ever-shorter timescales are being forced on teams?in this fastmoving area, projects lasting three months or less are common. You might think, therefore, that it would be particularly difficult to involve users in such projects. However, Braiterman et al. (2000) report two case studies showing how to involve users successfully in large-scale but very short multidisciplinary projects, belying the claim that involving users can waste valuable development time.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | The first case study was a three-week project to develop the interaction for a new web shopping application. The team included a usability designer, an information architect, a project manager, content designers, and two graphic designers. In such a short timeframe, a long research phase and detailed prototyping sessions were impossible, so the team produced a hand-drawn paper prototype of the application that was revised daily in response to customer testing. The customers were asked to perform tasks with the prototype, which was manipulated by one of the team in order to simulate interaction, e.g. changing screens. After half the sessions were conducted, the team produced a more formal version of the prototype in Adobe Illustrator. They found that customers were enthusiastic about using the paper prototype and were keen to offer improvements. These improvements ranged from changes to terminology to task flow and page design changes such as the addition of full product descriptions and instructional information on shipment dates.
Degrees of User Involvement , last:. Using these as discussion points, the team were able to suggest specific improvements to the knowledge management tool being developed, including: | Box 9.2: How Microsoft involves users
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Microsoft involves its users throughout development in a variety of ways, from product and feature identification to feature development and testing, and via the customer support call centers.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Microsoft bases feature selection and prioritization on a technique called ?eactivity-based planning.?f This technique involves studying what users do to achieve a certain activity like writing a letter, and using the results of the study to choose product features. Each new release of a software product is limited to supporting about four new major activities. Each of these proposed new activities can be broken down into sub-activities, and these mapped against features already existing in the software. Any new features required are noted. If a feature can support more than one activity, then it is placed higher in the priority list. The techniques used to gather customer data for activity-based planning do not appear to be prescribed in any way, and can vary from visiting customers through to asking them to use an instrumented version of the software, i.e. a version that records the actions they take. Microsoft also employs contextual inquiry (see chapter 10)  to learn about their customers' work, although they find that it can be time-consuming and the results ambiguous.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Because the world of applications software changes so rapidly, developers need to continually observe and test with users. Throughout the development phase, usability tests are carried out in Microsoft's usability lab. Each time a developer believes that a feature is finished, then it is scheduled for testing in the usability lab. A group of about 10 users ?eoff the street?f are invited into the lab to perform certain tasks, while their behavior is observed and their performance recorded. The data is then analyzed and the findings fed back into development. This results in thorough testing of all features. As an example, an early version of Office 4.0 went through over 8000 hours of usability testing.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Once a product is complete, it is used internally by Microsoft staff (who are selected users and atypical, but are using it in a realistic working environment); then it may be released in a beta version to selected customers.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Microsoft has millions of customers around the world, about 30% of whom call their customer support lines with problems and frustrations resulting from poor features or software errors. This data about customer behavior and their problems with the products is a further source of information that is fed back into product development and improvement.
Degrees of User Involvement , last:. Using these as discussion points, the team were able to suggest specific improvements to the knowledge management tool being developed, including: | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995)
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): The second case study involved the development of a website for a video game publisher over three months. In order to understand what attracts people to such gaming sites, the multidisciplinary team felt they needed to understand the essence of gaming. To do this, they met 32 teenage gamers over a 10day period, during which they observed and interviewed them in groups and individually. This allowed the team to understand something of the social nature of gaming and gave insights into the gamers themselves. During design, the team also conducted research and testing sessions in their office lab. This led them to develop new strategies and web designs based on the gamers' habits, likes, and dislikes.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Box 9.3 describes a situation in which users were asked to manage a software development project. There were hundreds of potential users, and so in addition, users became design team members on a full- and part-time basis; regular design workshops, debriefings, and training sessions were also held.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): How actively users should be involved is a matter for debate. Some studies have shown that too much user involvement can lead to problems. This issue is discussed in the Dilemma box below.

The courses are presented through paper-based and electronic media including DVDs with video and audio resources. It has a network of centers through which it supports and distributes courses to students throughout the UK and Europe. The OU employs about 3000 academic and other full-time staff and about 6000 part-time and counseling staff. The University has around 200,000 students and customers for its education packs, and manages a network of distributors operating in over 30 countries. Such an operation requires considerable computerized support: in 1993 approximately 54 major systems of varying sizes were held on mainframe UN-LX host/workstations, VAX hosts, or PCs.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Traditionally, the systems had been built by an in-house software development team, who, due to resource constraints, sometimes needed to make business decisions although their expertise was in technical issues, not in the business side of the University. When it was time to redevelop these information systems, the OU decided that a new approach to development was required: users were to have a much more significant role.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Development was divided into a number of areas, each with its own project team and its own schedule. Consistency across the areas was maintained through the development of a GUI interface standard style guide that ensured all systems had the same look and feel (style guides are discussed in Chapter 6). Users were involved in development on a number of different levels, typically 30?80% of their time. For example, in one area (Area E), one user was appointed full-time to manage the project team, two others joined the project team part-time for a limited period (about 18 months each), one user was consulted on a regular basis, and a wider set of users were involved through workshops and prototyping sessions. The project team also included technically trained analysts and developers.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): When asked for the most successful and the least successful aspects of the project, both users and technical developers agreed that the most successful had been getting users involved in development. They said that this had made the system closer to what the users wanted. The users' reactions were not all favorable, however. One user commented that, because users were part of the team for only a limited time, they did not see the development through from the beginning, but saw only some of the phases, and that this led to lack of continuity. Another user commented on the fact that the business had changed faster than the software could be developed, and hence the system had to be changed. Another group of users who were consulted mainly through workshops and prototyping sessions did not feel that their needs had been adequately addressed.
Degrees of User Involvement , last:. Using these as discussion points, the team were able to suggest specific improvements to the knowledge management tool being developed, including: | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): One of the user project managers had this to say:
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): The most successful thing has been getting people to go back to basics. We didn't look at existing systems and say, "We want the same thing but with go-faster stripes." We've examined what the University wants from the area. The most disappointing part has been that increased user involvement has not brought about ownership of the system by user areas. There was an expectation that we could move away from the traditional view of, "This is a computer system devised by computer people for you to use." In practice it's been far more difficult to get users to make decisions; they tend to say, "That's part of development. You decide."
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): This lack of ownership was commented upon by users and developers alike. One of the analysts commented:
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): The user-led aspect has resulted in [the system's][1] greatest successes and greatest failures. User project managers do not have a systems background. Depending on their character they can be open to ideas or very blinkered. If they come from a user area with a system already it can be hard for them to see beyond their current system. M (M880, 2000)
Degrees of User Involvement , last:. One of the analysts commented: | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Dilemma: Too much of a good thing?
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Involving users in development is a good thing. Or is it? And how much should they become involved? Box 9.3 describes a project in which users were appointed as project managers and were actively involved in development throughout. But are users qualified to lead a technical development project? And does this matter, provided there is sufficient technical expertise in the team?
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Involving users at any level incurs costs, whether in terms of time for communication, or for workshops, or time spent explaining technical issues. Detailed user studies may also require the use of recording equipment and the subsequent cost of transcription and analysis. What evidence is there that user involvement is productive, or that it is worth putting the required level of resources into development? Research by Keil and Carmel (1995) indicates that the more successful projects do have direct links to users and customers. Kujala and Mantyla (2000) performed some empirical work to investigate the costs and benefits of user studies early in product development. They concluded that user studies do in fact produce benefits that outweigh the costs of conducting them.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): On the other hand, Heinbokel et al. (1996) suggest that a high user involvement has some negative effects. They found that projects with high user participation showed lower overall success, fewer innovations, a lower degree of flexibility, and low team effectiveness, although these effects were noticeable only later in the project (at least 6?12 months into the project). In short, projects with a high level of user participation tended to run less smoothly. They identified four issues related to communication among users and developers that they suggest caused problems. First, as the project progressed, users developed more sophisticated ideas, and they wanted them to be incorporated late in the project. Second, users were fearful of job losses or worsening job conditions and this led to a tendency for participation to be not constructive. Third, users were unpredictable and not always sympathetic to software development matters. For example, they asked for significant changes to be made just as testing was due to start. Fourth, user orientation in the designers may lead to higher aspirations and hence higher levels of stress.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Webb (1996) too has concerns about user involvement, but Scaife et al. (1997) suggest that it is not the fact of user involvement that is in question, but how and at what stage in development they should get involved.
What is a User-Centered Approach? , last:. One of the analysts commented: | 9.2.3 What is a User-Centered Approach?
What is a User-Centered Approach? ,  | Throughout this book, we emphasize the need for a user-centered approach to development. By this we mean that the real users and their goals, not just technology, should be the driving force behind development of a product. As a consequence, a well-designed system will make the most of human skill and judgment, will be directly relevant to the work in hand or other activity, and will support rather than constrain the user. This is less of a technique and more of a philosophy.
What is a User-Centered Approach? ,  | In 1985, Gould and Lewis (1985) laid down three principles they believed would lead to a "useful and easy to use computer system:"
What is a User-Centered Approach? , 1.	Early focus on users and tasks. This means first understanding who the users will be by directly studying their cognitive, behavioral, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics. This requires observing users doing their normal tasks, studying the nature of those tasks, and then involving users in the design process. | 1.	Early focus on users and tasks.

This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of ?edesign, test, measure, and redesign?f being repeated as often as necessary. | 3.	Iterative design.

In fact, they comment in their paper how ?eobvious?f these principles are, and remark that when they started recommending these to designers, the designers' reactions implied that these principles were indeed obvious. However, when they asked designers at a human factors symposium for the major steps in software design, most of them did not cite most of the principles?in fact, only 2% mentioned all of them.

The Olympic Messaging System (OMS) (Gould et al., 1987) was the first reported large computer-based system to be developed using these three principles. Here a combination of techniques was used to elicit users' reactions to designs, from the earliest prototypes through to the final product. In this case, users were mainly involved in evaluating designs. The OMS is discussed further in Chapter 12.

What is a User-Centered Approach? , 2.	Users' behavior and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them. This is about more than just capturing the tasks and the users' goals. How people perform their tasks is also significant. Understanding behavior highlights priorities, preferences, and implicit intentions. One argument against studying current behavior is that we are looking to improve work, not to capture bad habits in automation. The implication is that exposing designers to users is likely to stifle innovation and creativity, but experience tells us that the opposite is true (Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1998). In addition, if something is designed to support an activity with little understanding of the real work involved, it is likely to be incompatible with current practice, and users don't like to deviate from their learned habits if operating a new device with similar properties (Norman, 1988). | 2.

What is a User-Centered Approach? , 3.	Users' characteristics are captured and designed for. When things go wrong with technology, we often say that it is our fault. But as humans, we are prone to making errors and we have certain limitations, both cognitive and physical. Products designed to support humans should take these limitations into account and should limit the mistakes we make. Cognitive aspects such as attention, memory, and perception issues were introduced in Chapter 3. Physical aspects include height, mobility, and strength. Some characteristics are general, such as that about one man in 12 has some form of color blindness, but some characteristics may be associated more with the job or particular task at hand. So, as well as general characteristics, we need to capture those specific to the intended user group. | 3.	Users' characteristics are captured and designed for.

As this is a new site, there is no immediate set of users to consult. However, the tasks and goals, behavior, and characteristics of potential users of this site can be identified by investigating how people shop in existing online and physical shopping situations?for example, shopping through interactive television, through other online sites, in a garden center, in the local corner shop, and so on. For each of these, you will find advantages and disadvantages to the shopping environment and you will observe different behaviors. By looking at behavior and patterns in a physical garden center, you can find out a lot about who might be interested in buying plants, how these people choose plants, what criteria are important, and what their buying habits are. From existing online shopping behavior, you could determine likely contexts of use for the new site. There may be occasions when online shopping behavior conflicts with physical shopping behavior, e.g. someone in the garden center likes to smell the flowers before buying their seeds, while online decisions are based upon the descriptions and pictures of the plants. In this case, as a designer you will need to interpret your findings to create a suitable balance, and evaluate any solution you suggest.

These people may be involved in workshops or in evaluation sessions, possibly in a physical shopping environment. Valuable input can be gained in targeted workshops, focus groups, and evaluation sessions. The last principle could be supported through the creation of a design room to house all the data collected.

As users and designers engage with the domain and start to discuss requirements, needs, hopes, and aspirations, then different insights into what is needed, what will help, and what is feasible will emerge. This leads to a need for iteration, for the activities to inform each other and to be repeated. However good the designers are and however clear the users may think their vision is of the required artifact, it will be necessary to revise ideas in light of feedback, several times. This is particularly true if you are trying to innovate. Innovation rarely emerges whole and ready to go. It takes time, evolution, trial and error, and a great deal of patience. Iteration is inevitable because designers never get the solution right the first time (Gould and Lewis, 1985).
Four Basic Activities of Interacti , last:. One of the analysts commented: | 9.2.4 Four Basic Activities of Interaction Design
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Four basic activities for interaction design were introduced in Chapter 1, some of which you will have engaged in when doing Activity 9.1. These are: identifying needs and establishing requirements for the user experience, developing alternative designs that meet those requirements, building interactive versions of the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed, and evaluating what is being built throughout the process and the user experience it offers. They are fairly generic activities and can be found in other design disciplines too. For example, in architectural design (RIBA[2], 1988) basic requirements are established in a work stage called ?einception,?f alternative design options are considered in a ?efeasibility?f stage, and ?ethe brief is developed through outline proposals and scheme design. During this time, prototypes may be built or perspectives may be drawn to give clients a better indication of the design being developed. Detail design specifies all components, and working drawings are produced. Finally, the job arrives on site and building commences.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | We will be expanding on each of the basic activities of interaction design in the following chapters. Here we give only a brief introduction to each.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti , last:. One of the analysts commented: | Identifying Needs and Establishing Requirements for the User Experience
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | In order to design something to support people, we must know who our target users are and what kind of support an interactive product could usefully provide. These needs form the basis of the product's requirements and underpin subsequent design and development. This activity is fundamental to a usercentered approach, and is very important in interaction design. Understanding these needs is gleaned through data gathering and analysis, which were discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. The requirements activity is discussed further in Chapter 10.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti , last:. One of the analysts commented: | Developing Alternative Designs That Meet Those Requirements
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | This is the core activity of designing: actually suggesting ideas for meeting the requirements. This activity can be broken up into two sub-activities: conceptual design and physical design. Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the product, and a conceptual model describes what the product should do, what it should look like and how it should behave. Physical design considers the detail of the product including the colors, sounds, and images to use, menu design, and icon design.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Alternatives are considered at every point. You met some of the ideas for conceptual design in Chapter 2, and some more design issues for specific interface types in Chapter 6; we go into more detail about how to design an interactive product in Chapter 11.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti , last:. One of the analysts commented: | Building Interactive Versions of the Designs
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Interaction design involves designing interactive products. The most sensible way for users to evaluate such designs, then, is to interact with them. This requires an interactive version of the designs to be built, but that does not mean a software version is required. There are different techniques for achieving ?einteraction,?f not all of which require a working piece of software. For example, paper-based prototypes are very quick and cheap to build and are very effective for identifying problems in the early stages of design, and through role-playing users can get a real sense of what it will be like to interact with the product. This aspect is also covered in Chapter 11.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti , last:. One of the analysts commented: | Evaluating What is Being Built Throughout the Process and the User Experience it Offers
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Evaluation is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design that is measured in terms of a variety of criteria including the number of errors users make using it, how appealing it is, how well it matches the requirements, and so on. Interaction design requires a high level of user involvement throughout development, and this enhances the chances of an acceptable product being delivered. In most design situations you will find a number of activities concerned with quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is ?efit-for-purpose.?f Evaluation does not replace these activities, but complements and enhances them. We devote Chapters 12 to 15 to the important subject of evaluation.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | The activities of developing alternative designs, building interactive versions of the design, and evaluation are intertwined: alternatives are evaluated through the interactive versions of the designs and the results are fed back into further design. This iteration is one of the key characteristics of a user-centered approach.

Four Basic Activities of Interacti , 10.2.1 What are We Trying to Achieve in the Requirements Activity? | There are two aims. One aim is to understand as much as possible about the users, their work, and the context of that work, so the system under development can support them in achieving their goals; this we call "identifying needs." Building on this, our second aim is to produce, from the needs identified, a set of stable requirements that form a sound basis to move forward into thinking about design. This is not necessarily a major document nor a set of rigid prescriptions, but you need to be sure that it will not change radically in the time it takes to do some design and get feedback on the ideas. Because the end goal is to produce this set of requirements, we shall sometimes refer to this as the requirements activity.

Four Basic Activities of Interacti , 10.2.2 How can We Achieve This? | This whole chapter is devoted to explaining how to achieve these aims, but first we give an overview of where we're heading.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti , 10.2.2 How can We Achieve This? | At the beginning of the requirements activity, we know that we have a lot to find out and to clarify. At the end of the activity we will have a set of stable requirements that can be moved forward into the design activity. In the middle, there are activities concerned with data gathering, analysis, interpretation, and presentation, with the aim of capturing the findings in a form that can be expressed as requirements. Broadly speaking, these activities progress in a sequential manner: first gather some data, then analyze and interpret it, then extract some requirements from it, but it gets a lot messier than this, and the activities influence one another as the process iterates. One of the reasons for this is that once you start to analyze data, you will find that you need to gather some more data to clarify or c

Prototyping and Construction , last: | 11.2 Prototyping and Construction
Prototyping and Construction ,  | It is often said that users can't tell you what they want, but when they see something and get to use it,
Prototyping and Construction ,  | they soon know what they don't want. Having collected information about work and everyday practices,
Prototyping and Construction ,  | and views about what a system should and shouldn't do, we then need to try out our ideas by building
Prototyping and Construction ,  | prototypes and iterating through several versions. And the more iterations, the better the final product will be.
What is a Prototype? , last: | 11.2.1 What is a Prototype?
What is a Prototype? , last: | When you hear the term prototype, you may imagine something like a scale model of a building or a
What is a Prototype? , last: | bridge, or maybe a piece of software that crashes every few minutes. But a prototype can also be a
What is a Prototype? ,  | paper-based outline of a screen or set of screens, an electronic ?epicture,?f a video simulation of a task, a
What is a Prototype? ,  | three-dimensional paper and cardboard mockup of a whole workstation, or a simple stack of hyperlinked screen shots, among other things.
What is a Prototype? , last: | In fact, a prototype can be anything from a paper-based storyboard through to a complex piece of
What is a Prototype? ,  | software, and from a cardboard mockup to a molded or pressed piece of metal. A prototype allows stakeholders to interact with an envisioned product, to gain some experience of using it in a realistic setting, and to explore imagined uses.
What is a Prototype? , last: | For example, when the idea for the PalmPilot was being developed, Jeff Hawkin
What is a Prototype? ,  | (founder of the company) carved up a piece of wood about the size and shape of the device he had imagined. He used to carry this piece of wood around with him and pretend to enter information into it, just to see what it would be like to
What is a Prototype? , last: | own such a device (Bergman and Haitani, 2000). This is an example of a very simple
What is a Prototype? , last: | (some might even say bizarre) prototype, but it served its purpose of simulating scenarios of use.
What is a Prototype? ,  | Ehn and Kyng (1991) report on the use of a cardboard box with the label ?eDesktop Laser Printer?f as a
What is a Prototype? ,  | mockup. It did not matter that, in their setup, the printer was not real. The important point was that the
What is a Prototype? ,  | intended users, journalists and typographers, could experience and envision what it would be like to have
What is a Prototype? ,  | one of these machines on their desks. This may seem a little extreme, but in 1982 when this was done, desktop laser printers were expensive items of equipment and were not a common sight around the office.
What is a Prototype? ,  | So a prototype is a limited representation of a design that allows users to interact with it and to explore its suitability.
Why Prototype? , last: | 11.2.2 Why Prototype?
Why Prototype? ,  | Prototypes are a useful aid when discussing ideas with stakeholders; they are a communication device among team members, and are an effective way to test out ideas for yourself. The activity of building
Why Prototype? , last: | prototypes encourages reflection in design, as described by Schon (1983) and as recognized by
Why Prototype? , last: | designers from many disciplines as an important aspect of the design process. Liddle
Why Prototype? , last: | (1996), talking
Why Prototype? , last: | (1996), talking: about software design, recommends that prototyping should always precede any writing of code.
Why Prototype? ,  | (1996), talking: Prototypes answer questions and support designers in choosing between alternatives. Hence, they serve
Why Prototype? ,  | (1996), talking: a variety of purposes: for example, to test out the technical feasibility of an idea, to clarify some vague
Why Prototype? ,  | (1996), talking: requirements, to do some user testing and evaluation, or to check that a certain design direction is compatible with the rest of the system development. Which of these is your purpose will influence the kind of prototype you build. So, for example, if you are trying to clarify how users might perform a set of tasks
Why Prototype? , last: | (1996), talking: and whether your proposed design would support them in this, you might produce a paper-based
Why Prototype? ,  | (1996), talking: mockup. Figure 11.1 shows a paper-based prototype of the design for a handheld device to help an autistic child communicate. This prototype shows the intended functions and buttons, their positioning and labeling, and the overall shape of the device, but none of the buttons actually work. This kind of prototype
Why Prototype? , last: | (1996), talking: is sufficient to investigate scenarios of use and to decide, for example, whether the buttons are
Why Prototype? ,  | (1996), talking: appropriate and the functions sufficient, but not to test whether the speech is loud enough or the response fast enough.
Why Prototype? ,  | (1996), talking: Heather Martin and Bill Gaver (2000) describe a different kind of prototyping with a different purpose.
Why Prototype? ,  | (1996), talking: When prototyping audiophotography products, they used a variety of different techniques including video scenarios similar to the scenarios we introduced in Chapter 10, but filmed rather than written. At each
Why Prototype? ,  | (1996), talking: stage, the prototypes were minimally specified, deliberately leaving some aspects vague so as to stimulate further ideas and discussion.
Low-Fidelity Prototyping , last: | 11.2.3 Low-Fidelity Prototyping
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | A low-fidelity prototype is one that does not look very much like the final product. For example, it uses materials that are very different from the intended final version, such as paper and cardboard rather than
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | electronic screens and metal. The lump of wood used to prototype the PalmPilot described above is a low-fidelity prototype, as is the cardboard-box laser printer.
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | Low-fidelity prototypes are useful because they tend to be simple, cheap, and quick to produce. This also
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | means that they are simple, cheap, and quick to modify so they support the exploration of alternative
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | designs and ideas. This is particularly important in early stages of development, during conceptual design
Low-Fidelity Prototyping , last: | for example, because prototypes that are used for exploring ideas should be flexible and encourage
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | rather than discourage exploration and modification. Low-fidelity prototypes are never intended to be kept and integrated into the final product. They are for exploration only.
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | Storyboarding. Storyboarding is one example of low-fidelity prototyping that is often used in conjunction
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | with scenarios, as described in Chapter 10. A storyboard consists of a series of sketches showing how a
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | user might progress through a task using the product under development. It can be a series of sketched screens for a GUI-based software system, or a series of scene sketches showing how a user can perform
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | a task using an interactive device. When used in conjunction with a scenario, the storyboard brings more
Low-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | detail to the written scenario and offers stakeholders a chance to role-play with the prototype, interacting
Low-Fidelity Prototyping , last: | with it by stepping through the scenario. The example storyboard shown in Figure

High-Fidelity Prototyping , last: | 11.2.4 High-Fidelity Prototyping
High-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | High-fidelity prototyping uses materials that you would expect to be in the final product and produces a
High-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | prototype that looks much more like the final thing. For example, a prototype of a software system developed in Visual Basic is higher fidelity than a paper-based mockup; a molded piece of plastic with a
High-Fidelity Prototyping , last: | dummy keyboard is a higher-fidelity prototype of the PalmPilot than the lump of wood.
High-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | If you are to build a prototype in software, then clearly you need a software tool to support this. Common
High-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | prototyping tools include Flash, Visual Basic, and Smalltalk. These are also fullyfledged development environments, so they are powerful tools, but building prototypes using them can also be straightforward.
High-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | In a classic paper, Marc Rettig (1994) argues that more projects should use lowfidelity prototyping because of the inherent problems with high-fidelity prototyping. He identifies these problems as:
High-Fidelity Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | They take too long to build.
High-Fidelity Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | They take too long to build.: Reviewers and testers tend to comment on superficial aspects rather than content.
High-Fidelity Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | They take too long to build.: Developers are reluctant to change something they have crafted for hours.
High-Fidelity Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | They take too long to build.: A software prototype can set expectations too high.
High-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | They take too long to build.: Just one bug in a high-fidelity prototype can bring the testing to a halt. High-fidelity prototyping is useful for selling ideas to people and for testing out technical issues. However,
High-Fidelity Prototyping ,  | They take too long to build.: the use of paper prototyping and other ideas should be actively encouraged for exploring issues of content and structure. Further advantages and disadvantages of the two types of prototyping are listed in

Compromises in Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | 11.2.5 Compromises in Prototyping
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | By their very nature, prototypes involve compromises: the intention is to produce something quickly to test
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | an aspect of the product. The kind of questions or choices that any one prototype allows the designer to answer is therefore limited, and the prototype must be designed and built with the key issues in mind. In low-fidelity prototyping, it is fairly clear that compromises have been made. For example, with a paper-based prototype an obvious compromise is that the device doesn't actually work! For
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | software-based prototyping, some of the compromises will still be fairly clear; for example, the response speed may be slow, or the exact icons may be sketchy, or only a limited amount of functionality may be available.
Compromises in Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | Box 11.1: Prototyping cultures
Compromises in Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | "The culture of an organization has a strong influence on the quality of the innovations that the
Compromises in Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | organization can produce." (Schrage, 1996, p. 193)
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | This observation is drawn mainly from product-related organizations, but also applies to software development. There are primarily two kinds of organizational culture for innovation: the specification culture and the prototyping culture. In the former, new products and development are driven by written
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | specifications, i.e. by a collection of documented requirements. In the latter, understanding requirements
Compromises in Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | and developing the new product are driven by prototyping. Large companies such as IBM or AT&T that
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | have to gather and coordinate a large amount of information tend to be specification-driven, while smaller entrepreneurial companies tend to be prototype-driven. Both approaches have potential disadvantages. A carefully prepared specification may prove completely infeasible once prototyping begins. Similarly, a wonderful prototype may prove to be too expensive to produce on a large scale. David Kelley (Schrage, p. 195) claims that organizations wanting to be innovative need to move to a
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | prototype-driven culture. Schrage sees that there are two cultural aspects to this shift. First, scheduled prototyping cycles that force designers to build many prototypes are more likely to lead to a prototypedriven culture than allowing designers to produce ad hoc prototypes when they think it appropriate.
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | Second, rather than innovative teams being needed for innovative prototypes, it is now recognized that innovative prototypes lead to innovating teams! This can be especially significant when the teams are cross-functional, i.e. multidis-ciplinary.
Compromises in Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | (Schrage, 1996)
Compromises in Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | (Schrage, 1996): Two common compromises that often must be traded against each other are breadth of functionality
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): provided versus depth. These two kinds of prototyping are called horizontal prototyping (providing a wide
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): range of functions but with little detail) and vertical prototyping (providing a lot of detail for only a few functions).
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): Other compromises won't be obvious to a user of the system. For example, the internal structure of the
Compromises in Prototyping , last:. He identifies these problems as: | (Schrage, 1996): system may not have been carefully designed, and the prototype may contain
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): ?espaghetti code?f or may be badly partitioned. One of the dangers of producing running prototypes, i.e. ones that users can interact
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): with automatically, is that they may believe that the prototype is the system. The danger for developers is
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): that it may lead them to consider fewer alternatives because they have found one that works and that the users like. However, the compromises made in order to produce the prototype must not be ignored,
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): particularly the ones that are less obvious from the outside. We still have to produce a good-quality system and good engineering principles must be adhered to.
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): A different point is made by Holmquist (2005), who points out that the design team themselves must be careful not to inadvertently design something that is not technically feasible. Claiming that a mobile device will be able to detect the state of its user automatically and modify its behavior accordingly is fairly simple to do when you only have a paper prototype to play with, however, having a paper model does not mean
Compromises in Prototyping ,  | (Schrage, 1996): that a claimed feature can be implemented. This is one reason why it is important to have technical and design knowledge in an interactive design team.

Construction: From Design to Impl , last:. He identifies these problems as: | When the design has been around the iteration cycle enough times to feel confident that it fits

Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | Although prototypes will have undergone extensive user evaluation, they will not necessarily have been

Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | Constructing a product to be used by thousands or millions of people running on various platforms and

Construction: From Design to Impl , last:. He identifies these problems as: | The dilemma box below discusses two different development philosophies. One approach, called
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | evolutionary prototyping, involves evolving a prototype into the final product. An alternative approach,
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | called throwaway prototyping, uses the prototypes as stepping stones towards the final design. In this
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | case, the prototypes are thrown away and the final product is built from scratch. If an evolutionary prototyping approach is to be taken, the prototypes should be subjected to rigorous testing along the way; for throw-away prototyping such testing is not necessary.
Construction: From Design to Impl , last:. He identifies these problems as: | Dilemma: Prototyping to throw away
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | Low-fidelity prototypes are never intended to be kept and integrated into the final product. But when building a software-based system, developers can choose to do one of two things: either build a
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | prototype with the intention of throwing it away after it has fulfilled its immediate purpose, or build a prototype with the intention of evolving it into the final product.
Construction: From Design to Impl , last:. He identifies these problems as: | Above, we talked about the compromises made when producing a prototype, and we commented
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | that the ?einvisible?f compromises, concerned with the structure of the underlying software must not be
Construction: From Design to Impl , last:. He identifies these problems as: | ignored. However, when a project team is under pressure to produce the final product and a complex
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | prototype exists that fulfills many of the requirements, or maybe a set of vertical prototypes exists that together fulfill the requirements, it can become very tempting to pull them together and issue the result as the final product. After all, many hours of development have probably gone into developing the prototypes, and evaluation with the client has gone well, so isn't it a waste to throw it all away?
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | Basing the final product on prototypes in this way will simply store up testing and maintenance problems for later on: in short, this is likely to compromise the quality of the product.
Construction: From Design to Impl ,  | Evolving the final prototype into the final product through a defined process of evolutionary prototyping can lead to a robust final product, but this must be clearly planned and designed for from

When to Evaluate ,  | At what stage in the product lifecycle evaluation takes place depends on the type of product itself. For
When to Evaluate ,  | example, the product being developed may be a brand-new concept or an upgrade of an existing product.
When to Evaluate ,  | If the product is new, then considerable time is usually invested in market research and establishing user
When to Evaluate ,  | requirements. Once these requirements have been established, they are used to create a design artifact such as initial sketches, a series of screens, or a prototype of the design ideas. These are then evaluated
When to Evaluate ,  | to see if the designers have interpreted the users' requirements correctly and embodied them in their
When to Evaluate ,  | designs appropriately. The designs will be modified according to the evaluation feedback and a new set of prototypes will be developed and then evaluated.
When to Evaluate ,  | When a product is upgraded there is usually less scope for change than when designing a new product,
When to Evaluate ,  | and attention is focused on improving specific aspects of the product's design such as how to navigate through a website. Some products, such as office systems, go through many versions, and successful
When to Evaluate ,  | products may reach double-digit version numbers. If the product is being upgraded then evaluation is not
When to Evaluate ,  | necessarily dependent on establishing a set of requirements, and evaluation may be the first step in redesign.
When to Evaluate ,  | Evaluations that are done to assess the success of a finished product, such as those needed to satisfy a funding agency that its money has been used well or to check that a standard is being upheld, are known as summative evaluations. Agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in
When to Evaluate ,  | the USA, the International Standards Organization (ISO), and the British Standards Institute (BSI) set standards by which products may be evaluated.
When to Evaluate ,  | When evaluations are done during design to check that the product continues to meet users' needs they are know as formative evaluations. Formative evaluations cover a broad span of design, from the
When to Evaluate ,  | development of early sketches and prototypes through to tweaking and perfecting an almost finished design, and then maintaining the product, which may involve several upgrades. In the case studies in Section 12.5 we examine evaluations that have been performed during:

Identify the Practical Issues ,  | There are many practical issues to consider when doing any kind of evaluation, and it is important to
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | identify as many of them as possible before starting the study. However, even experienced evaluators
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | encounter surprise events, which is why it is useful to do a pilot study (discussed in Chapter 7). Some issues that should be considered include access to appropriate users, facilities and equipment, whether
Identify the Practical Issues , last:.2? These were: | schedules and budgets are realistic, and whether the evaluators have the appropriate expertise to
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | conduct the study. Depending on the availability of resources, there may have to be compromises that
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | involve adapting or substituting methods. For example, evaluators may wish to perform usability tests
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | using 20 users and then to run a three-week-long field study, but the budget available for the study may
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | only cover the cost of five testers and a shorter field study. Another example is provided by the Nokia cell
Identify the Practical Issues , last:.2? These were: | phone, which involved evaluating cell phones in a country where the evaluators do not speak the
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | language fluently and are only slightly aware of cultural norms. In this situation the evaluators had to work out how to collect the data that they needed to answer their evaluation questions. Furthermore, cell phone users are highly mobile so the evaluators knew that there would be places where the cell phones would
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | be used that they could not go, e.g. in bathrooms, bedrooms. During the study the evaluators may also have experienced surprise events that required them to take decisions there and then. For example, it
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | may not have been possible to ride in the taxi or car with the user because there was not enough room.
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | Of course, no evaluation is going to be perfect, and a good field study can be done without the evaluator
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | seeing how the product is used 100% of the time, but it is helpful to be aware of the kind of compromises that may be necessary. Thinking about the kind of users who will be involved and logistical issues, such as availability of equipment, the schedule and the budget, and the kind of expertise needed to perform the study, when planning a study will help to ensure its success. Users
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | It goes without saying that a key aspect of an evaluation is involving appropriate users or, in the case of
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | analytical evaluation, focusing on the characteristics of the anticipated user population. When doing
Identify the Practical Issues , last:.2? These were: | usability testing, for example, users must be found who represent the user population for which the
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | product is targeted. This generally involves identifying users with a particular level of experience, e.g. novices or experts, or users with a range of expertise. The number of males and females within a
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | particular age range, cultural diversity, educational experience, and personality differences may also need to be taken into account, depending on the kind of product being evaluated. Questionnaire surveys
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | require large numbers of participants, so ways of identifying and reaching a representative sample of
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | participants are needed. For field studies to be successful, the evaluator needs access to users who will interact with the technology in their natural setting.
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | Another issue to consider is how the users will be involved. The tasks used in a usability laboratory study
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | should be representative of those for which the product is designed. However, there are no written rules about the length of time that a user should be expected to spend on an evaluation task. Ten minutes is
Identify the Practical Issues , last:.2? These were: | too short for most tasks and two hours is a long time, so what is reasonable? Task times will vary
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | according to the type of evaluation, but when tasks go on for more than 20 minutes, consider offering breaks. It is accepted that people using desktop computers should stop, move around, and change their
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | position regularly after every 20 minutes spent at the keyboard to avoid repetitive strain injury. Evaluators
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | also need to put users at ease so they are not anxious and will perform normally; it is important to treat
Identify the Practical Issues , last:.2? These were: | them courteously. Participants should not be made to feel uncomfortable when they make mistakes.
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | Greeting users, explaining that it is the product that is being tested and not them, and planning an activity
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | to familiarize them with it before starting the task all help to put users at ease in test situations.
Identify the Practical Issues ,  | In field studies the onus is on the evaluators to fit in with the users and to cause as little disturbance to participants and their activities as possible. This requires practice, and even anthropologists who are

Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Decisions are must be made about what data is needed to answer the study questions, how the data will
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | be analyzed, and how the findings will be presented (see Chapter 8). To a great extent the method used determines the type of data collected, but there are still some choices. For example, should the data be

Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | results? Will the results be generalizable, i.e. what is their scope? Will the evaluation study be ecologically valid or is the fundamental nature of the process being changed by studying it?
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  , last:. Three principles of particular relevance to this discussion are: | Reliability
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Reliability: The reliability or consistency of a method is how well it produces the same results on separate occasions under the same circumstances. Another evaluator or researcher who follows exactly the same procedure
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Reliability: should get similar results. Different evaluation methods have different degrees of reliability. For example, a carefully controlled experiment will have high reliability, whereas observing users in their natural setting
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Reliability: will be variable. An unstructured interview will have low reliability: it would be difficult if not impossible to repeat exactly the same discussion.
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  , last:. Three principles of particular relevance to this discussion are: | Reliability: Validity
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Validity: Validity is concerned with whether the evaluation method measures what it is intended to measure. This
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Validity: encompasses both the method itself and the way it is performed. If, for example, the goal of an evaluation study is to find out how users use a new product in their homes, then it is not appropriate to plan a
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Validity: laboratory experiment. An ethnographic study in users' homes would be more appropriate. If the goal is to
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Validity: find average performance times for completing a task, then a method that only recorded the number of user errors would be invalid. Biases
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Validity: Bias occurs when the results are distorted. For example, expert evaluators performing a heuristic evaluation may be more sensitive to certain kinds of design flaws than others, and this will be reflected in
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Validity: the results. Evaluators collecting observational data may consistently fail to notice certain types of behavior because they do not deem them important. Put another way, they may selectively gather data
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Validity: that they think is important. Interviewers may unconsciously influence responses from interviewees by their tone of voice, their facial expressions, or the way questions are phrased, so it is important to be sensitive to the possibility of biases.
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  , last:. Three principles of particular relevance to this discussion are: | Validity: Scope
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Scope: The scope of an evaluation study refers to how much its findings can be generalized. For example, some modeling methods, like the keystroke model, have a narrow, precise scope. The model predicts expert, error-free behavior so, for example, the results cannot be used to describe novices learning to use the system. The problems of overstating the results were discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  , last:. Three principles of particular relevance to this discussion are: | Scope: Ecological Validity
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Ecological Validity: Ecological validity concerns how the environment in which an evaluation is conducted influences or even
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Ecological Validity: distorts the results. For example, laboratory experiments are controlled and are quite different from
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Ecological Validity: workplace, home, or leisure environments. Laboratory experiments therefore have low ecological validity because the results are unlikely to represent what happens in the real world. In contrast, ethnographic
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  , last:. Three principles of particular relevance to this discussion are: | Ecological Validity: studies do not impact the environment as much, so they have high ecological validity.
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Ecological Validity: Ecological validity is also affected when participants are aware of being studied. This is sometimes called
Evaluate, Interpret, and Present  ,  | Ecological Validity: the Hawthorne effect after a series of experiments at the Western Electric Company's Hawthorne factory in the USA in the 1920s and 1930s. The studies investigated changes in length of working day, heating,

Similar findings sometimes occur in medical trials. Patients given the placebo dose (a false dose in which no drug is administered) show improvement that is due to receiving extra attention that makes them feel good.

Conducting Experiments in Usabili , last:. The performance data contained the following: | 14.2.2 Conducting Experiments in Usability Testing
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Sometimes, it is important to test a specific hypothesis that makes a prediction about the way users will perform
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | with an interface. In this context, the user test is run more like a scientific experiment. An example of a hypothesis is: context menus are easier to select options from compared with cascading menus. Hypotheses are often based on a theory, such as Fitt's Law (see next chapter), or previous research findings. Specific measurements are
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | decided upon as a way of testing the hypothesis. In the above example, the accuracy of selecting menu options
Conducting Experiments in Usabili , last:. The performance data contained the following: | would be compared by counting the number of errors each participant makes for each menu type.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Typically, a hypothesis involves examining a relationship between two things, called variables. In the above example the variables are menu types and error rate. Another example of a relationship that could be tested is
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | between time and font, for the hypothesis "reading text displayed in 12-point Helvetica font is faster than reading text displayed in 12-point Times New Roman." Variables can be independent or dependent. An independent
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | variable is what the investigator ?emanipulates?f (i.e. selects), and in the above example it is the different font types.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | The experimenter could have equally selected to compare another sans serif with a serif font, e.g. Geneva versus
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Times. The other variable is called the dependent variable, and in our example, this is the time taken to read the text. It is a measure of the user performance and if our hypothesis is correct, will vary depending on the different types of font used.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | When setting up a hypothesis to test the effect of the independent variable(s) on the dependent variable it is usual to derive a ?enull?f and an ?ealternative?f one. The null hypothesis in our example would state that there is no difference
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | between Helvetica and Times font on reading time. The alternative hypothesis would state that there was a difference between the two on reading time. When a difference is specified but not what it will be, it is called a
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | two-tailed hypothesis. This is because it can be interpreted in two ways: either the Helvetica font or the Times font is faster to read. Alternatively, the hypothesis can be stated in terms of one effect. This is called a one-tailed hypothesis and would state that Helvetica is easier to read than Times, or vice versa. A one-tailed hypothesis would be made if there was a strong reason to believe it to be the case. For example, it could be based on the
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | findings of previous experiments investigating paper-based text that have all shown that sans serif is easer to read because of the simple shape form of the letters. A two-tailed hypothesis would be chosen if there was no reason or
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | theory that could be used to support the case that the predicted effect would go one way or the other.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | You might ask why do you need a null hypothesis since it seems the reverse of what the experimenter believes.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Counter-intuitively, it is put forward to allow the data to contradict it. If the experimental data shows a big difference between reading times for the two different fonts, then the null hypothesis that font type has no effect can be
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | rejected. Conversely, if there is no difference between the two then the alternative hypothesis is rejected, i.e. the claim that Helvetica font is easier to read is not supported.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | In order to test a hypothesis, the experimenter has to set up the conditions and find ways to keep other variables constant, to prevent them from influencing the findings. This is called the experimental design. Examples of other
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | variables that need to be kept constant for both fonts include color of text and screen resolution. For example, if the text is blue in one condition and black in the other then it could be this which causes the effect (i.e. differences
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | in reading rates). Often a control condition is set up as part of the experimental design. This is typically used when you want to determine if a new method (e.g. presenting learning material as dynamic multimedia software), enhances performance (e.g. learning) compared with an existing method (e.g. presenting the same material in an
Conducting Experiments in Usabili , last:. The performance data contained the following: | static paper-based form). More than one condition can be compared with the control, for example:
Conducting Experiments in Usabili , last:. More than one condition can be compared with the control, for example: | Control condition = Paper-based
Conducting Experiments in Usabili , last:. More than one condition can be compared with the control, for example: | Condition 1 = Multimedia
Conducting Experiments in Usabili , last:. More than one condition can be compared with the control, for example: | Condition 1 = Multimedia: Condition 2 = Virtual reality
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: The independent variable in this example is the type of media, e.g. paper-based, multimedia, virtual reality. The
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: dependent variable measures learning performance, and could include the number of questions that are answered successfully for each condition before and after the experiment.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: Sometimes an experimenter might want to investigate the relationship between two independent variables, for
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: example, age and educational background. A hypothesis might be that young people are faster at finding text on
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: the web than older people and that those with a scientific background are more effective at selecting search terms.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: An experiment would be set up to measure the time it takes to complete the task and number of searches carried
Conducting Experiments in Usabili , last:. More than one condition can be compared with the control, for example: | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: out. The analysis of the data would focus on both the effects of the main variables
Conducting Experiments in Usabili , last:. More than one condition can be compared with the control, for example: | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: (age and background) and also look for any interactions among them.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: Hypothesis testing can also be extended to include even more variables, but it makes the experimental design
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: more complex. An example is testing the effects of age and educational background on user performance for two methods of web searching: one a search engine and the other a browser. Again, the goal is to test the effects of
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: the main variables (age background, web searching method) and to look for any interactions among them.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: However, as the number of variables increases in an experimental design, it makes it more difficult to work out from the data what is causing the results.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: Another concern in experimental design is to determine which participants to use for which conditions of an
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: experiment. The experience of participating in one condition will affect the performance of those participants if asked to partake in another condition. For example, having learned about the way the heart works using a multimedia condition it would be unfair to expose the same participants to the same learning material via another medium, e.g. virtual reality. The reason being that they would have had more time to learn about the same topic and this would increase their chances of answering more questions correctly. In some experimental designs,
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: however, it is possible to use the same participants for all conditions without letting such training effects bias the results.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: The names given for the different designs are: different-participant design, sameparticipant design, and matched-pairs design. In different-participant design, a single group of participants is allocated randomly to each of
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: the experimental conditions, so that different participants perform in different conditions. In experimental jargon this is called between-subjects. An advantage is that there are no ordering or training effects, caused by the influence
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: of participants' experience of one set of tasks on performance in the next, as each participant only ever performs in one condition. A disadvantage is that large numbers of participants are needed so that the effect of any individual
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: differences among participants, such as differences in experience and expertise, is minimalized. Randomly allocating the participants and pre-testing to identify any participants that differ strongly from the others can help.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: In same-participant design, all participants perform in all conditions so only half the number of participants is needed; the main reason for this design is to lessen the impact of individual differences and to see how
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: performance varies across conditions for each participant. In experimental jargon this is called within-subjects. It is important to ensure that the order in which participants perform tasks for this set-up does not bias the results. For
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: example, if there are two tasks, A and B, half the participants should do task A followed by task B and the other half should do task B followed by task A. This is known as counterbalancing. Counterbalancing neutralizes possible unfair effects of learning from the first task, i.e. the order effect. In matched-participant design, participants are matched in pairs based on certain user characteristics such as
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: expertise and gender. Each pair is then randomly allocated to each experimental condition. A problem with this arrangement is that other important variables that have not been taken into account may influence the results. For
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: example, experience in using the web could influence the results of tests to evaluate the navigability of a website.
Conducting Experiments in Usabili ,  | Condition 2 = Virtual reality: So web expertise would be a good criterion for matching participants. The advantages and disadvantages of using different experimental designs are summarized in Table 14.3.
