More on usability: design and usability principles 1.1 Introduction How many interactive products are there in everyday use? Think for a minute about what you use in a typical day: cell phone, computer, personal organizer, remote control, soft drink machine, coffee machine, ATM, ticket machine, library information system, the web, photocopier, watch, printer, stereo, calculator, video game.. . the list is endless. Now think for a minute about how usable they are|
,  | How many are actually easy, effortless, and enjoyable to use? All of them, several, or just one or two? This list is probably considerably shorter. Why is this so? Think about when some device caused you considerable grief-how much time did you waste trying to get it to work? Two well-known interactive devices that cause numerous people immense grief are the photocopier that doesn't copy the way they want and the VCR that records a different program from the one they thought they had set or none at all. Why do you think these things happen time and time again? Moreover, can anything be done about it? Many products that require users to interact with them to carry out their tasks (e.g., buying a ticket online from the web, photocopying an article, pre-recording a TV program) have not necessarily been designed with the users in mind. Typically, they have been engineered as systems to perform set functions. While they may work effectively from an engineering perspective, it is often at the expense of how the system will be used by real people. The aim of interaction design is to redress this concern by |

, last: | By interaction design, we mean
,  | designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.
,  | Put another way, it is about creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact. More generally, Winograd (1997, p. 160) describes it as "designing spaces for human communication and interaction." Thackara views it as "the why as well as the how of our daily interactions using computers" (2001, p. 50).
,  | A number of terms have been used to emphasize different aspects of what is being designed, including user interface design, software design, user-centered design, product design, web design, experience design, and interactive system design. Interaction design is increasingly being accepted as the umbrella term, covering all of these aspects. Indeed, many practitioners and designers, who ten years ago would have described what they were doing as interface design or interactive system design, now promote what they are doing as interaction design.
,  | The focus of interaction design is very much concerned with practice, i.e. how to design user experiences. It is not wedded to a particular way of doing design, but is more eclectic, promoting the use of a range of methods, techniques, and frameworks. Some interaction designers have since begun to put forward their own perspective, for example, Cooper and
,  | Reiman (2003) present their take on interaction design as ?goal-directed?Eand Lowgren and Stolterman (2004) as ?thoughtful.?E
,  | How does interaction design differ from other approaches to the design of computer-based systems, such as software engineering? A simple analogy to another profession, concerned with creating buildings, may clarify this difference. In his account of interaction design, Terry Winograd asks how architects and civil engineers differ when faced with the problem of building a house. Architects are concerned with the people and their interactions with each other and with the house being built. For example, is there the right mix of family and private spaces? Are the spaces for cooking and eating in close proximity? Will people live in the space being designed in the way it was intended to be used? In contrast, engineers are interested in issues to do with realizing the project. These include practical concerns like cost, durability, structural aspects, environmental aspects, fire regulations, and construction methods. Just as there is a difference between designing and building a house, so too is there a distinction between designing an interactive product and engineering the software for it.
The Components of Interaction Desi ,  | We see the main difference between Interaction Design (ID) and Human?Computer Interaction (HCI) as one of scope. ID has cast its net much wider, being concerned with the theory, research, and practice of designing user experiences for all manner of technologies, systems, and products, whereas HCI has traditionally had a narrower focus, being "concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them" (ACM SIGCHI, 1992, p. 6). That is one of the reasons why we chose to call our book Interaction Design: Beyond Human?Computer Interaction, to reflect the wider scope.
Who is Involved in Interaction Des ,  | One of the benefits of bringing together people with different backgrounds and training is the potential of many more ideas being generated, new methods developed, and more creative and original designs being produced. However, the down side is the costs involved. The more people there are with different backgrounds in a design team, the more difficult it can be to communicate and progress forward the designs being generated. Why? People with different backgrounds have different perspectives and ways of seeing and talking about the world (see Figure 1.5) . What one person values as important others may not even see (Kim, 1990). Similarly, a computer scientist's understanding of the term ?representation?Eis often very different from a graphic designer's or a psychologist's.
Who is Involved in Interaction Des ,  | What this means in practice is that confusion, misunderstanding, and communication breakdowns can surface in a team. The various team members may have different ways of talking about design and may use the same terms to mean quite different things. Other problems can arise when a group of people is ?thrown?Etogether who have not worked as a team. For example, the Philips Vision of the Future Project found that its multidisciplinary teams?who were responsible for developing ideas and products for the future?Eexperienced a number of difficulties, namely, that project team members did not always have a clear idea of who needed what information, when, and in what form (Lambourne et al., 1997).

the Design Space ,  | Having a good understanding of the problem space greatly helps design teams progress to the next phase of the design process, which is to conceptualize the design space. Primarily this involves describing what the system is going to be to the users, through developing a conceptual model?we explain how to do this in the next section. The design space can also be conceptualized in other ways, including exploring the nature of the interaction that underlies user activities (see Section 2.3.4)  and through the lenses of different theories, models, and frameworks (see Section 2.4) . A benefit of conceptualizing the design space using one or more of these is that it can inform and systematically structure a design solution.
Conceptual Models ,  | The concepts that users are exposed to through the product, including the task?domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them.
Conceptual Models ,  | iv. The mappings: By exploring the relationships between the various components of the conceptual model, the design team can debate the merits of providing different methods and how they support the main concepts, e.g. saving, revisiting, categorizing, reorganizing, and their mapping to the task domain. They can also begin discussing whether a new metaphor may be preferable that combines the activities of browsing and searching. In turn, this can lead the design team to articulate the importance of containership as a relationship. For example, what is the best way to sort and revisit saved objects and how many and what types of containers, e.g. folders, bars, are most fitting for the task domain? The same enumeration of concepts can be repeated for other functions of the web browser?both current and new. In so doing, the design team can begin to systematically work out what will be the most simple, effective, and memorable way of supporting users while browsing the Internet.
Conceptual Models ,  | iv. The mappings: Developing a conceptual model can at first seem daunting, especially for those not trained or versed in thinking at an abstract level. It can be much easier to talk about a design idea in concrete terms, such as deciding upon the look and feel of a proposed system, the layout of menu options and other graphical elements, and where information will appear on a screen. But as stressed throughout this chapter, these types of decisions should not be made until the foundations of the system have been worked out?just as architects and interior designers would not think about which color curtains to have before they have decided upon where the windows will be placed in a plan for a new building.
Examples of Best Practice , last:. Johnson and Henderson (2002)  propose that a conceptual model should comprise the following components : | The Spreadsheet?VisiCalc (Bricklin and Frankston)
Examples of Best Practice ,  | The conceptual model was based on an analogy of the paper-based ledger sheet that was used in accounting practice at the time (Winograd, 1996). Bricklin and Frankston also conceptualized problematic aspects of the task domain that could substantially be improved upon through using a computer-based tool. For example, they observed that a core financial activity is forecasting. This requires projecting financial results based on assumptions about a company, such as projected and actual sales, investments, infrastructure, and costs. The amount of profit or loss is calculated for different projections. A company may want to determine how much loss it will incur before it achieves break-even, based on different amounts of investment, for different periods of time. Financial analysts need to see a spread of projections for different time periods. Doing this kind of multiple projecting by hand requires much effort and is subject to human error. Using a calculator can reduce the computational load of doing numerous sums but there is still much key pressing and writing down of partial results to be done?again making the process protracted and prone to errors.
Examples of Best Practice ,  | Bricklin and Frankston exploited the interactivity provided by microcomputers and developed an application that was capable of interactive financial modeling. Key goals of their conceptual model were: (i) to create a spreadsheet that was analogous to a ledger sheet in the way it looked, with columns and rows, that allowed people to capitalize on their familiarity with how to use this kind of representation; (ii) to make the spreadsheet interactive, by allowing the user to input and change data in any of the cells in the columns or rows; and (iii) to have the computer perform a range of different calculations and recalculations in response to user input. For example, the last column could be programmed to display the sum of all the cells in the columns preceding it. With the computer doing all the calculations, together with an easy-to-learn-and-use interface, users were provided with an easy-tounderstand tool, based on a simple conceptual model (see Figure 2.2) . Moreover, it gave them a new way of effortlessly working out any number of forecasts?greatly extending what they could do before with existing technology.
Examples of Best Practice ,  | The simplicity of this conceptual model is clear and it is not surprising that it received much critical acclaim. For various business reasons, however, VisiCalc did not become a successful commercial product. But many of the basic concepts and the metaphor that were inherent in its conceptual model became widely adopted by other software companies. Most notable, as acknowledged by Bricklin and Frankston on their website, is Microsoft's Excel 97 spreadsheet which has many similarities to VisiCalc?even 18 years after its inception (see Figure 2.3).
Examples of Best Practice ,  | The Star Interface (Based on Miller and Johnson, 1996 and Smith et al., 1982) Another classic of its time was the 8010 ?Star?Esystem, developed by Xerox in 1981, that revolutionized the way interfaces were designed for personal computing. Like VisiCalc, it received great acclaim but was not commercially successful, and lo and behold many aspects of its conceptual model were borrowed and adapted by other companies, such as Apple and Microsoft, that later appeared in their very successful Mac and Windows products.
Examples of Best Practice ,  | Star was designed as an office system, targeted at workers not interested in computing per se. An important consideration was to make the computer as ?invisible?Eto the users as possible and to design applications that were suitable for them. The Star developers spent several person-years at the beginning of the project working out an appropriate conceptual model for such an office system. In the end they selected a conceptual model based on an analogy to a physical office. They wanted office workers to imagine the computer to be like an office environment, by acting on electronic counterparts of physical objects in the real world. Their assumption was that this would simplify and clarify the electronic world, making it seem more familiar, less alien, and easier to learn (see Figure 2.4).
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | An interface metaphor is considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. It provides a structure that is similar in some way to aspects of a familiar entity (or entities) but that also has its own behaviors and properties. Consider the term search engine. It has been designed to invite comparison with a common object?a mechanical engine with several parts working?together with an everyday action?searching by looking through numerous files in many different places to extract relevant information. The functions supported by a search engine also include other features besides those belonging to an engine that searches, such as listing and prioritizing the results of a search. It also does these actions in quite different ways from how a mechanical engine works or how a human being might search a library for books on a given topic. The similarities implied by the use of the term ?search engine,?Etherefore, are at a general level. They are meant to conjure up the essence of the process of finding relevant information, enabling the user to link these to less familiar aspects of the functionality provided.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | People frequently use metaphors and analogies (here we use the terms interchangeably) as a source of inspiration to understand and explain to others what they are doing or trying to do, in terms that are familiar to them. They are an integral part of human language (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). Metaphors are commonly used to explain something that is unfamiliar or hard to grasp by way of comparison with something that is familiar and easy to grasp. For example, they are commonly employed in education, where teachers use them to introduce something new to students by comparing the new material with something they already understand. An example is the comparison of human evolution with a game. We are all familiar with the properties of a game: there are rules, each player has a goal to win (or lose), there are heuristics to deal with situations where there are no rules, there is the propensity to cheat when the other players are not looking, and so on. By conjuring up these properties, the analogy helps us begin to understand the more difficult concept of evolution?how it happens, what rules govern it, who cheats, and so on.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | As names for describing specific operations, e.g. ?cut?Eand ?paste?Ecommands for deleting and copying objects (analogy taken from the media industry).
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Comment: Some other examples include: Scrollbar?combines the concept of a scroll with a bar, as in bar chart. Toolbar?combines the idea of a set of tools with a bar.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies , last:. This use includes: | Comment: Web Portal?a gateway to a particular collection of pages of networked information.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Comment: Interface metaphors have proven to be highly successful, providing users with a familiar orienting device and helping them understand and learn how to use a system. People find it easier to learn and talk about what they are doing at the computer interface in terms familiar to them?whether they are computerphobic or highly experienced programmers.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Comment: Metaphorically-based commands used in Unix, like ?lint?Eand ?pipe,?Ehave very concrete meanings in everyday language that, when used in the context of the Unix operating system, metaphorically represent some aspect of the operations they refer to. Although their meaning may appear obscure, especially to the novice, they make sense when understood in the context of programming. For example, Unix allows the programmer to send the output of one program to another by using the pipe | symbol. Once explained, it is easy to imagine the output from one container going to another via a pipe.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Two are:: Java?The programming language Java originally was called Oak, but that name had already been taken. It is not clear how the developers moved from Oak to Java. Java is a name commonly associated with coffee. Other Java-based metaphors that have been spawned include Java beans ( a reusable software component) and the steaming coffee-cup logo.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Two are:: Bluetooth?Bluetooth is used in a computing context to describe the wireless technology that is able to unite technology, communication, and consumer electronics. The name is taken from King Harald Blue Tooth, who was a 10th century legendary Viking king responsible for uniting Scandinavia and thus getting people to talk to each other.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Two are:: Breaks the rules. Several commentators have criticized the use of interface metaphors because of the cultural and logical contradictions involved in accommodating the metaphor when instantiated as a GUI. A pet hate is the recycle bin (trashcan) that used to sit on the desktop. Logically and culturally (i.e. in the real world), it should be placed under the desk. If this same rule was followed in the virtual desktop, users would not be able to see the bin because it would be occluded by the desktop surface. A counterargument to this objection is that it does not matter whether rules are contravened. Once people understand why the bin is on the desktop, they readily accept that the real-world rule had to be broken. Moreover, the unexpected juxtaposition of the bin on the desktop can draw to the user's attention the additional functionality that it provides. The trashcan now appears in the toolbar of the Mac operating systems?but the same logic applies?is a trashcan a tool? Moreover, does it matter?
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Two are:: Conflicts with design principles. By trying to design the interface metaphor to fit in with the constraints of the physical world, designers are forced into making bad design solutions that conflict with basic design principles. Ted Nelson used the trashcan as an example of such violation: "a hideous failure of consistency is the garbage can on the Macintosh, which means either ?destroy this?Eor ?eject it for safekeeping?E (Nelson, 1990). The trashcan has now been designed to transform into an abstract ?eject?Eicon on the Mac when an icon of an external drive, disk, or memory stick is selected from the desktop and moved towards it, thereby reducing the ambiguity associated with the original metaphor.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Two are:: Limits the designer's imagination in conjuring up new paradigms and models. Designers may fixate on ?tired?Eideas, based on well-known technologies, that they know people are very familiar with. Nelson points out that one of the dangers of always looking backwards is that it prevents the designer from thinking of new functionality to provide. For example, Gentner and Nielsen (1996) discuss how they used a book metaphor for designing the user interface to Sun Microsystems' online documentation. In hindsight they realized how it had blinkered them in organizing the online material, preventing them from

Examples include giving instructions to a system to perform operations such as tell the time, print a file, and remind the user of an appointment. A diverse range of products has been designed based on this model, including VCRs, hi-fi systems, alarm clocks, and computers. The way in which the user issues instructions can vary from pressing buttons to typing in strings of characters. Many activities are readily supported by giving instructions.

In Windows and other GUI-based systems, control keys or the selection of menu options via a mouse are used. Typically, a wide range of functions are provided from which users have to select when they want to do something to the object on which they are working. For example, a user writing a report using a wordprocessor will want to format the document, count the number of words typed, and check the spelling. The user instructs the system to do these operations by issuing appropriate commands. Typically, commands are carried out in a sequence, with the system responding appropriately (or not) as instructed.

It is particularly fitting where there is a need to frequently repeat actions performed on multiple objects. Examples include the repetitive actions of saving, deleting, and organizing files.

There are a small number of drinks to choose from and each is represented by a large button displaying the label of each drink. The user simply has to press one button and this should have the effect of returning the selected drink. The second machine is more complex, offering a wider range of snacks. The trade-off for providing more choices, however, is that the user can no longer instruct the machine by using a simple one-press action but is required to use a more complex process, involving: (i) reading off the code, e.g. C12, under the item chosen; then (ii) keying this into the number pad adjacent to the displayed items; and (iii) checking the price of the selected option and ensuring that the amount of money inserted is the same or greater ( depending on whether or not the machine provides change). Problems that can arise from this type of interaction are the customer misreading the code and/or miskeying in the code, resulting in the machine not issuing the snack or providing the wrong item.

This would use the available space at the front of the vending machine more economically. The customer would need only to press the button of the object chosen and put in the correct amount of money. There is less chance of error resulting from pressing the wrong code or keys. The trade-off for the vending company, however, is that the machine is less flexible in terms of which snacks it can sell. If a new product line comes out they will also need to replace part of the physical interface to the machine?which would be costly.

How many instructions have to be given? What order are they given in? Is it logical or arbitrary? Could the interaction have been designed any differently to make it more obvious to people how to issue instructions to the machine to get the desired train ticket?

They are often not standardized. Therefore, a person's knowledge of the Eurostar ticketing machine in London will not be useful when buying a ticket for the Sydney Monorail or cinema tickets for the Odeon. Sometimes the interaction has been designed where the user has to specify the type of ticket first, e.g. adult, child, the kind of ticket, e.g. single, return, special saver, then the destination, and finally to insert their money. Others require that the user insert a credit card first, before selecting the destination and the type of ticket.

Examples of the former include banking, ticket booking, and train-time inquiries, where the user talks to the system in single-word phrases and numbers e.g. yes, no, three, in response to prompts from the system. Examples of the latter include search engines and help systems, where the user types in a specific query e.g. "how do I change the margin widths?", to which the system responds by giving various answers.

For example, the search engine ?Ask Jeeves for Kids!?Eallows children to ask a question in a way they would when asking their teachers or parents?rather than making them reformulate their question in terms of keywords and Boolean logic. Similarly, the generation of virtual representatives that have been incorporated into online store websites offer customers quick and direct answers to their product-related queries.

For example, virtual objects can be manipulated by moving, selecting, opening, and closing. Extensions to these actions include zooming in and out, stretching, and shrinking?actions that are not possible with objects in the real world. Physical toys and robots have also been embedded with computation and capability that enables them to act and react in programmable ways depending on whether they are squeezed, touched, sensed, or moved. Tagged physical objects, e.g. balls, bricks, blocks, that are manipulated in a physical world, e.g. placed on a surface, can result in other physical and digital events occurring, such as a lever moving or a sound, comment, or animation being played. For example, the Chromarium color cubes were designed to enable children to mix colors (a very familiar physical activity) using a novel form of physical?digital interaction (Rogers et al., 2002a). The two colored cubes have hidden RFID tags[1] embedded in them; when they are placed next to a RFID reader (in this case a covered plinth on the table), a computer detects which colors are face up. In Figure 2.8 the faces showing are red and yellow. Their digital counterparts are depicted on the large vertical screen on the wall, together with an animation of the resulting color when the two colors are mixed?in this case it is orange.

One of the main benefits, when used in this context, is to encourage creativity and playfulness. In a study exploring color mixing, it was found that young children (aged 4?E years) were far more creative, collaborative, and reflective when mixing colors with the physical?digital cubes compared with mixing digital colored disks as part of software applications (Rogers et al., 2002a). In particular, they explored many more combinations and tried to see if they could change the density of the colors being mixed, for example, by placing the cubes on top of each other and pressing them hard on the table.

One form of manipulative?the Cricket?comprises a tiny microchip processor, that is capable of two-way infrared communication and controlling motors and sensors (Resnick et al., 1998). Crickets can be programmed and combined with physical artifacts, sensors, and motors to enable students to explore programming concepts in novel physical ways.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Manipulating: Apple Computer Inc. was one of the first computer companies to design an operating environment that used direct manipulation as its central mode of interaction. The highly successful Macintosh desktop demonstrates the main principles of direct manipulation (see Figure 2.10) . One of their assumptions was that people expect their physical actions to have physical results, so when a drawing tool is used, a corresponding line should appear and when a file is placed in the trashcan, a corresponding sound or visual cue showing it has been successfully thrown away is used (Apple Computer Inc., 1987). A number of visual and auditory cues was used to provide such feedback, including various animations and sounds, e.g. shrinking and expanding icons accompanied with ?shhhlicc?Eand ?crouik?Esounds to represent opening and closing of files). Much of the interaction design was geared towards providing clues to the user to know what to do, to feel comfortable, and to enjoy exploring the interface. More recent Mac interfaces follow the same principles, but have become more colorful, use more animation, and provide more detailed icons that have a 3D perspective.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Manipulating: Many applications have been developed based on some form of direct manipulation, e.g. wordprocessing packages, video games, learning tools, and image editing tools. However, while direct manipulation interfaces provide a very versatile mode of interaction they do have their drawbacks. In particular, not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be undertaken directly. Some tasks are also better achieved through issuing commands. For example, consider how you edit an essay using a wordprocessor. Suppose you had referenced work by Ben Shneiderman but had spelled his name as Schneiderman, with an extra ?c?Ethroughout the essay. How would you correct this error using a direct manipulation interface? You would need to read through your essay and manually select the ?c?Ein every ?Schneiderman,?Ehighlighting and then deleting it. This would be very tedious and it would be easy to miss one or two. By contrast, this operation is relatively effortless and also likely to
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Manipulating: be more accurate when using a command-based interaction. All you need to do is instruct the wordprocessor to find every ?Schneiderman?Eand replace it with ?Shneiderman.?EThis can be done through selecting a menu option or using a combination of command keys and then typing the changes required into the dialog box that pops up.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Exploring: A number of physical environments have been developed in which are embedded sensor technologies and other location-detection technologies. They are often called context-aware environments: the location and/or presence of people in the vicinity of a sensing device is detected and based on this, the environment decides which digital information to provide on a device, e.g. a PDA, or which action to perform, e.g. changing lights in a room, that is considered relevant or useful to the person at a particular time and place. For example, a number of electronic tourist guides have been developed that run on mobile devices, e.g. PDAs and cell phones equipped with GPS, that provide information about restaurants, historical buildings, and other places of interest as the tourist wanders near them in an unfamiliar city (Cheverst et al., 2000). Physically embedded environments have also been designed to extend how children learn. For example, the Ambient Wood project was designed as an outdoor learning experience where a physical woodland was wired to present various forms of digital information to children, as they moved around it (Rogers et al., 2005). Depending on which part of the woodland they passed by, e.g. a particular kind of tree, a bush, a hole, an image would occasionally pop up on a PDA they were carrying, or a sound was played via hidden speakers or heard through a special handheld audio device?Ethe ambient horn (see Figure 2.14) . The idea was to provide contextually-relevant digital information that would enhance the ?usual?Ephysical experience available to children when exploring an outdoor world.

The idea behind the design of smart homes is that through using the various data collected and/or monitored, contextually relevant forms of digital information can be provided to the occupants or others, e.g. caregivers, family members, at appropriate times in different parts of the house or other places. A few, much publicized, smart homes were built based on this philosophy, including the ?Aware Home?Ein the USA (Abowd et al., 2000) , the ?Ubiquitous Home?Ein Japan (Yamazake, 2005), and the ?Orange-at-Home?Ein the UK (Harper, 2003) . Living experiments were subsequently conducted to see how real families would respond and adapt to such a set-up, over a period of several months. Activity 2.7

Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Comment: Advocates of the agent approach, e.g. Nicholas Negroponte claim it can be much more versatile than direct manipulation or command-based interfaces, allowing users to do what they want to do through delegating the boring and time-consuming tasks to an agent. Negroponte uses the analogy of a well-trained English butler who answers the phone, tends to a person's needs, fends off callers, and tells ?white lies?Eif necessary on his master's behalf. Similarly, a digital butler is designed to read a user's email and flag the important ones, scout the web and newsgroups for interesting information, screen unwanted electronic intrusions, and so on. This approach assumes that people like to delegate work to others rather than directly interact with computers themselves.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Comment: Advocates of the direct manipulation approach, e.g. Ben Shneiderman, suggest that it is preferable because it allows users to enjoy mastery and being in control.

Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Comment: Advocates of the command-based approach go one step further, arguing that many tasks are best carried out at an abstract level, where the user is completely in control. Issuing abstract commands based on a carefully designed set of syntax and semantics is often a very efficient and elegant way of performing many operations. This is especially the case for repetitive operations, where the same action needs to be performed on multiple objects. Examples include sorting out files, deleting accumulated email messages, opening and closing files, and installing applications comprising multiple files?which when done by direct manipulation or through delegation can be inefficient or ambiguous.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Comment: Besides the four core activities of instructing, conversing, manipulating, and exploring, there are many other ways of describing the specific domain and context-based activities users engage in, such as learning, working, socializing, browsing, writing, problem-solving, decision-making, and informationsearching?to name but a few. We suggest that when considering how to design for these, it is useful to think about them in terms of the core interaction types, and in so doing, tease out the dilemmas and issues that might arise when using a particular interface.

Accordingly, feedback may be designed to be immediate or delayed.

Theories, Models, and Frameworks ,  | Other sources of inspiration and knowledge that are used to inform design and guide research are theories, models, and frameworks (Carroll, 2003). A theory is a wellsubstantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon, for example, the theory of information processing that explains how the mind, or some aspect of it, is assumed to work. A model is a simplification of some aspect of human?computer interaction intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions that is intended to inform a particular domain area, e.g. collaborative learning, online communities, or an analytic method, e.g. ethnographic studies.
Theories, Models, and Frameworks ,  | Models. Models are typically abstracted from a theory coming from a contributing discipline, e.g. psychology, that can be directly applied to interaction design. For example, Norman (1988) developed a number of models of user interaction based on theories of cognitive processing arising out of cognitive science, that were intended to explain the way users interacted with interactive technologies. These include his cyclical seven stages of action model (see Chapter 3) ?Ethat describes how users move from their plans to executing physical actions they need to perform to achieve them, to evaluating the outcome of their actions with respect to their goals. Another highly influential model based on cognitive theory that made its mark in the 1980s was Card, Moran, and Newell's keystroke model (see Chapters 3 and 15). This was used by a number of researchers and designers as a predictive way of analyzing user performance for different interfaces to determine which would be the most effective. More recent models developed in interaction design are user models, that predict what information users want in their interactions, and models that characterize core components of the user experience, such as Norman's (2004) model of emotional design (Chapter 5).
Theories, Models, and Frameworks ,  | Frameworks. A number of frameworks have been introduced in interaction design to help designers constrain and scope the user experience for which they are designing. In contrast to a model?which is a simplification of a phenomenon?a framework offers advice to designers as to what to design or look for. This can come in a variety of forms, including steps, questions, concepts, challenges, principles, and dimensions. Frameworks, like models, have traditionally been based on theories of human behavior, but they are increasingly being developed from the experiences of actual design practice and the findings arising from user studies.
Theories, Models, and Frameworks ,  | There are many frameworks that have been published in the HCI/interaction design literatures, covering different aspects of the user experience and a diversity of application areas. For example, there are frameworks for helping designers think about how to conceptualize learning, working, socializing, fun, emotion, etc., and others that focus on how to design particular kinds of technologies to evoke certain responses, e.g. persuasive technologies and pleasurable products (see Chapter 5) . A classic early example of a conceptual framework that has been highly influential in human?computer interaction is Norman's (1988) explication of the relationship between the design of a conceptual model and a user's understanding of it (see Figure 2.17) . The framework depicts three interacting components: the designer, the user, and the system. Behind each of these are:
Theories, Models, and Frameworks ,  | Theories, models, and frameworks are not mutually exclusive but overlap in their way of conceptualizing the problem and design space, varying in their level of rigor, abstraction, and purpose. Theories tend to be comprehensive, explaining human?computer interactions; models tend to simplify some aspect of human?computer interaction, providing a basis for designing and evaluating systems; frameworks tend to be prescriptive, providing designers with concepts, questions, and principles to consider when designing for a user experience.

Frustrating Interfaces and Negative  ,  | This does not mean that developers are unaware of such usability problems. Several methods have been devised to help the novice user get set up and become familiarized with a technology. However, these have sometimes backfired, since the design solution itself has ironically become a source of annoyance and frustration. For example, one technique that was popularized in the 1990s was the use of friendly agents at the interface. The assumption was that novices would feel more at ease with a ?companion?Eand would be encouraged to try things out, after listening, watching, following, and interacting with it. Microsoft pioneered a class of agent-based software, Bob, aimed at new computer users (many of whom were viewed as computer-phobic). The agents were presented as friendly characters, including a pet dog and a cute bunny. An underlying assumption was that having these kinds of agents on the screen would make users feel more comfortable with using the software. An interface metaphor of a warm, cozy living room, replete with fire and furniture, was also provided (see Figure 5.5) ?Eagain intended to convey a comfortable feeling.

Frustrating Interfaces and Negative  ,  | Contrary to the designer's expectations, many people did not like the idea of Bob at all, finding the interface too cute and childish. However, Microsoft did not give up on the idea of making their interfaces more friendly and developed other kinds of agents, including the infamous ?Clippy?E(a paper clip that has human-like qualities), as part of their Windows 98 operating environment.[1] Clippy typically appeared at the bottom of a user's screen whenever the system ?thought?Ethe user needed help carrying out a particular task (see Figure 5.6) . It, too, was depicted as a cartoon character, with a warm personality. This time, Clippy was released as a commercial product but it was not a success. Many Microsoft users found it very trying and intrusive, distracting them from their work. When it was finally retired, numerous websites posted jokes and witty comments, celebrating its demise.

Frustrating Interfaces and Negative  , 2.	Error messages | Error messages have a long history in computer interface design, and are notorious for their incomprehensibility. For example, Nielsen (1993) describes an early system that was developed, allowing only for one line of error messages. Whenever the error message was too long, the system truncated it to fit on the line, which the users would spend a long time trying to decipher. The full message was available only by pressing the PF1 (help key) function key. While this may have seemed like a natural design solution to the developers, it was not at all obvious to the users. A much better design solution would have been to use the one line of the screen to indicate how to find more information about the current error?E"press the PF1 key for explanation".

Expressive Interfaces and Positive E ,  | Expressive forms like emoticons, sounds, icons, and virtual agents have been used at the interface to (i) convey emotional states and/or (ii) elicit certain kinds of emotional responses in users, such as feeling at ease, comfort, and happiness. Icons and animations have been used to indicate the current state of a computer or a cell phone, notably when it is waking up or being rebooted. A classic from the 1980s and 1990 s was the happy Mac icon that appeared on the screen of the Apple computer whenever the machine was booted (see Figure 5.2a) . The smiling icon conveyed a sense of friendliness, inviting the user to feel at ease and even smile back. The appearance of the icon on the screen was also very reassuring to users, indicating that their computer was working correctly. This was especially true for situations where users had to reboot their computer after it had crashed, and where previous attempts to reboot had failed (usually indicated by a sad icon face?see Figure 5.2b) . After 18 years, sadly, the happy Mac icon was laid to rest although the sad Mac icon now shows its face on an iPod if its software needs restoring (see Figure 5.2c) . MacOS has since switched to the use of more abstract icons to indicate starting up and busy with a process, showing a swirling clock or a colorful beach ball.
Expressive Interfaces and Positive E ,  | One of the benefits of using expressive embellishments is that they provide reassuring feedback to the user that can be both informative and fun. They can, however, sometimes have the opposite effect on people, who find them intrusive, causing them at times to get annoyed and even angry. This is especially so for ?cutesy?Elooking ones. How enjoyable they are perceived to be varies considerably across cultures. In South Korea and Japan, for example, cute cartoon characters such as those depicted in Manga comics have huge cult followings. Moreover, their influence has become widespread in the design of websites, video games, cell phone skins, etc. These include the use of large-eyed creatures such as those used in Pokemon and Pikachu games, and bright colors and pastels (Marcus, 2002).

Expressive Interfaces and Positive E ,  | Open table as spreadsheet: The style of an interface, in terms of the shapes, fonts, colors, balance, white space, and graphical elements that are used and the way they are combined, can also influence its affectiveness. Use of imagery at the interface can result in more engaging and enjoyable experiences (Mullet and Sano, 1995). Until recently, however, the focus of HCI was primarily on usability, with scant attention being paid to the design of aesthetically pleasing interfaces. Empirical studies showing that the aesthetics of an interface can have a positive effect on people's perception of the system's usability (Tractinsky, 1997, 2000) have begun to change that, and the importance of aesthetics is gaining acceptance within the HCI community. When the ?look and feel?Eof an interface is pleasing, e.g. beautiful graphics, nice feel to the way the elements have been put together, well-designed fonts, elegant use of images and color, a good sense of balance, users are likely to be more tolerant, e.g. they may be prepared to wait a few more seconds for a website to download. Furthermore, good-looking interfaces are often more satisfying and pleasurable to use. A key concern, therefore, is to strike a balance between designing pleasurable and usable interfaces (Tractinsky et al., 2000).
Expressive Interfaces and Positive E ,  | Comment: Aaron Marcus, a graphic designer, created the two designs in an attempt to provide appealing interfaces. Dialog box A was designed for white American females while dialog box B was designed for European adult male intellectuals.

In contrast, white American females "prefer a more detailed presentation, curvilinear shapes and the absence of some of the more brutal terms ?Efavored by male software engineers."

Social Mechanisms in Communication a ,  | A fundamental aspect of everyday life is being social?talking to one other. We continuously update each other about news, changes, and developments on a given project, activity, person, or event. For example, friends and families keep each other posted on what's happening at work, school, at the pub, at the club, next door, in soap operas, and in the news. Similarly, people who work together keep each other informed about their social lives and everyday happenings?as well as what is happening at work, for instance when a project is about to be completed, plans for a new project, problems with meeting deadlines, rumors about closures, and so on.
Social Mechanisms in Communication a ,  | The kinds of information that are circulated in different social circles are diverse, varying among social groups and across cultures. The frequency with which it is disseminated is also highly variable. It can happen continuously throughout the day, once a day, weekly, or infrequently. The means by which communication happens are also flexible?it can take place via face-to-face conversations, telephone, videophone, instant messaging, texting, email, fax, and letters. Non-verbal communication also plays an important role in augmenting face-to-face conversation, involving the use of facial expressions, back channeling (?aha?Eand ?umm?E, voice intonation, gesturing, and other kinds of body language.
Conversational Mechanisms ,  | Comment: The person answering the call will initiate the conversation by saying "hello" or more formally, the name of their company/department (and sometimes the phone number being called). If the phone has caller ID it can let the person answering the call know who he is talking to, which can enable him to be more personal, e.g. "Hello John, how are you doing?". Phone conversations usually start with a mutual greeting and end with a farewell one. In contrast, conversations that take place using IM have started to evolve new conventions. According to a Korean colleague?who is an avid user of IM?the older generation still tends to use opening and ending greetings when joining and leaving an IM, while the younger generation of users generally does without them, simply starting their message with what they want to talk about, and then stopping when they have got an answer, as if in the middle of a conversation. For example, an IM user might begin by typing "did you see the movie, Batman?," which is followed by a short conversation with someone on line, for example,

Conversational Mechanisms ,  | Comment: To facilitate rule following, people use various ways of indicating how long they are going to talk and on what topic. For example, a speaker might say right at the beginning of their turn in the conversation that he has three things to say. A speaker may also explicitly request a change in speaker by saying, "OK, that's all I want to say on that matter. So, what do you think?" to a listener. More subtle cues to let others know that their turn in the conversation is coming to an end include the lowering or raising of the voice to indicate the end of a question or the use of phrases like, "You know what I mean?" or simply, ?OK??EBack channeling (uhhuh, mmm), body orientation, e.g. moving away from or closer to someone, gaze (staring straight at someone or glancing away), and gesture, e.g. raising of arms, are also used in different combinations when talking, to signal to others when someone wants to hand over or take up a turn in the conversation.

Conversational Mechanisms ,  | Kinds of Conversations: Conversations can take a variety of forms, such as an argument, a discussion, a debate, a chat, a t?ete?Et?ete, or giving someone a ?telling off.?EA well-known distinction in conversation types is between formal and informal communication. Formal communication involves assigning certain roles to people and prescribing a priori the types of turns that people are allowed to take in a conversation. For example, at a board meeting, it is decided who is allowed to speak, who speaks when, who manages the turn-taking, and what the participants are allowed to talk about.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | 4.2.2 Designing Collaborative Technologies to Support Conversation As we have seen, ?talk?Eand the way it is managed is integral to coordinating social activities. One of the challenges confronting designers is to consider how the different kinds of communication can be facilitated and supported in settings where there may be obstacles preventing it from happening ?naturally.?EA central concern has been to develop systems that allow people to communicate with each other when they are in physically different locations and thus not able to communicate in the usual face-to-face manner. In particular, a key issue has been to determine how to allow people to carry on communicating as if they were in the same place, even though they are geographically separated ?sometimes many thousands of miles apart. Another challenge has been to design collaborative technologies to help colocated groups communicate and work together more effectively, especially when creating and sharing content.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | One of the earliest collaborative systems that was developed, based on a theory of conversational mechanisms, was the Coordinator system (Winograd and Flo-res, 1986). It was developed to help people work more effectively through improving the way they communicate with one another. An assumption was that communication could be improved if people could distinguish among the kinds of commitments they make in conversation that are normally implicit. The rationale behind the Coordinator system was to enable users to develop a better awareness of the value of using such ?speech acts.?E
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | The Coordinator system was targeted at a variety of work settings, including sales, finance, general management, and planning. Emails could be sent between people in the form of explicit speech acts. For example, when sending someone a request, say "Could you get the report to me," the sender could also select the menu option ?request.?EThis would be placed in the subject header of the message, thereby explicitly specifying the nature of the speech act. Other speech-act options included offer, promise, inform, and question. The system also asked the user to fill in the dates by which the request should be completed. The user receiving such a message had the option of responding with another labeled speech act. These included:

Connecting them was a 3 foot ? 8 foot ?picture-window?Eonto which video images were projected. The large size was meant to allow viewers to see a room of people roughly the same size as themselves. The system was designed to be active 24 hours a day, so that anyone entering one room could speak to whoever happened to be in the other room.

(1990) of how effective the system was showed that, in general, many of the interactions that took place between the remote conversants were indeed indistinguishable from similar face-to-face interactions?with the exception that they spoke a bit louder and constantly talked about the video system. However, they also found that people who were in the same room tended to talk more with each other than with those in the video-linked room. Various usability problems were identified as contributing to this reluctance to talk with video images of other people. One of these was the tendency for people to move closer to the picture window to strike up a conversation with someone (which is what one would normally do in a face-to-face setting); this had the opposite effect to what the person intended, as it moved his or her head out of the picture and also out of microphone range, meaning he or she could not be seen or heard. Thus, rather than getting nearer to the other person, this behavior had the counterintuitive effect of removing him or her from the ?picture.?EMoreover, there was no way for participants to know whether they were being seen and heard by the others in the other room. This inability to monitor how others are or are not ?receiving?Eyou caused numerous problems. Another problem was that the system allowed only public conversations, meaning that they could be heard by everyone in the rooms. Such public broadcasting contrasts with how people normally engage in informal face-to-face conversations, where they will often whisper and conspire with each other when a topic becomes more private or secret. Such private conversations clearly could not be supported by the VideoWindow system.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Box 4.2: Another early system, Cruiser, was designed to support informal communication by placing separate audio and video equipment on the desktop of each person who was connected to the system (Fish, 1989) . This set-up differed from the Vide-oWindow system in that it enabled both public and private interactions to take place. It also provided additional functionality that allowed people to initiate conversations by typing in a cruise command followed by a question like, "I'm bored. Anyone want a chat?" or "Can someone help me?"?Ethe aim here being explicitly to encourage people to engage in the kind of talk that they normally do when they bump into each other, but this time over the computer network. A further conversation mechanism built into Cruiser was a ?glance?Efeature that allowed users to check whether the person they wanted to talk to was in fact available before trying to initiate a conversation.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Box 4.2: Many commercial systems are now commonly used to support multiple connections among sites, using a combination of desktop and audio?video links. These can be very useful for virtual teams and centers that have multiple groups working at a number of different sites. High Definition TV has also improved the resolution and quality of images that can make people seem more present.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: On the other hand, it is interesting to look at how the new communication technologies have been extending the way people talk and socialize. SMS texting and instant messaging enable quite different ways of holding a conversation at a distance. Texting enables people to hold fragmentary conversations over long periods, commenting on what each is doing or thinking, allowing the other to keep posted on current developments. The conversation typically comprises short phrases that are typed in or selected from a menu of pre-stored phrases. These kinds of ?streamlined?Econversations are coordinated simply by taking turns sending and receiving messages. Online chatting and instant messaging have also resulted in new genres of conversation that compensate for the constraints of the medium, where shorthand and abbreviations are frequently used, e.g. the use of expressions like ?LOL?? laugh out loud?in response to someone typing in something funny that has happened to them. They also allow hundreds and even
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: An alternative approach is to design a physical space where people can enter and exit a conversation with a stranger in more subtle ways, i.e. one where people do not feel threatened or embarrassed, and which does not require a high level of commitment. The Opinionizer system was designed along these lines, with the aim of encouraging people in an informal gathering to share their opinions visually and anonymously (Brignull and Rogers, 2003). The collective creation of opinions via a public display was intended to provide a talking point to others standing beside it, and to comment on to their neighbor. Users submit their opinions by typing them in at a public keyboard. To add ?color?Eand ?personality?Eto their opinions, a selection of small cartoon avatars and speech bubbles were available. The screen was also divided into four labeled quadrants representing different backgrounds, e.g. ?techie,?E?softie,?E?designer,?Eor ?student?E to provide a further talking point.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: When the Opinionizer was placed in various social gatherings, a ?honey-pot?Eeffect was observed: as the number of people in the immediate vicinity of the Opinionizer increased, a sociable ?buzz?Ewas created in the area. By standing in this space and showing an interest,

Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Asynchronous communication: Flaming can take place, where a user writes an angry email expressed in uninhibited language that is much stronger than normal when interacting with the same person face-toface. This includes the use of impolite statements, exclamation marks, capitalized sentences or words, swearing, and superlatives. Such ?charged?Ecommunication can lead to misunderstandings and bad feelings among the recipients.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Asynchronous communication: Many people experience message overload, receiving numerous emails and junkmail each day. They find it difficult to cope and may overlook an important message while working through their ever-increasing pile of email?especially if they have not read it for a few days. Various interface mechanisms have been designed to help people manage their email better, including filtering, threading, and the use of signaling to indicate the level of importance of a message (which the sender or recipient can make), through color coding, bold font, or exclamation marks placed beside a message.

Advocates of the text-based approach, however, have argued that much is lost with having a graphical representation of the world, since participants no longer have to use their imagination to interpret the text: | Comment: ?overlapping?Eher and (c) virtual personal space is established

Coordination Mechanisms ,  | When people are working closely together they talk to each other, issuing commands and letting others know how they are progressing with their part. For example, when two or more people are collaborating together, as in moving a piano, they shout to each other commands like "Down a bit, left a bit, now straight forward" to coordinate their actions with each other. As in a conversation, nods, shakes, winks, glances, and hand-raising are also used in combination with such coordination ?talk?Eto emphasize and sometimes replace it.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | The tendency of people not to follow conventions can be due to a number of reasons. If following conventions requires additional work that is extraneous to the users' ongoing work, they may find it gets in the way. They may also perceive the convention as an unnecessary burden and ?forget?Eto follow it all the time. Such ?productive laziness?Eis quite common. A simple analogy to everyday life is forgetting to put the top back on the toothpaste tube: it is a very simple convention to follow and yet we are all guilty sometimes (or even all the time) of not doing this. While such actions may only take a tiny bit of effort, people often don't do them because they perceive them as tedious and unnecessary. However, the consequence of not doing them can be very annoying to others and make the system much less efficient and workable.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | A more flexible form of coordination is to include a social policy of floor control. Whenever a user wants to work on a shared document or file, he must initially request ?the floor.?EIf no one else is using the specified section or file at that time, then he is given the floor. That part of the document or file then becomes locked, preventing others from having access to it. If other users want access to the file, they likewise make a request for the floor. The current user is then notified and can then let the requester know how long the file will be in use. If not acceptable, the requester can try to negotiate a time for access to the file. This kind of coordination mechanism, therefore, provides more scope for negotiation between users on how to collaborate, rather than simply receiving a point-blank ?permission denied?Eresponse from the system when a file is being used by someone else.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | At one site, a project coordinator would write up on a physical whiteboard every morning the main projects, schedules, and deadlines relevant for that day fed from the online project management software. When asked why she laboriously wrote down by hand information that could be readily accessed by everyone over the computer network, she replied that, owing to the multiplication of projects and people working on them, it had become very difficult to keep track of everything that was going on. Moreover, people had become desensitized to the many email reminders that the software application provided, so they often forgot their significance immediately after having acknowledged them. Consequently, everyone ( including herself) needed to be reminded of what was urgent and what needed dealing with that day. Placing this critical information on a physical whiteboard in a prominent public place that was clearly distinct from the continuous stream of other online information and messages provided a more effective public reminder of what was urgent and needed doing that day. In essence, the company had resorted to ?turning the technology inside out?E
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: Electronic whiteboards have the added advantage that important information can be animated to make it stand out. Important information can also be displayed on multiple displays throughout a building and can be fed from existing databases and software, thereby making the project coordinator's work much easier. The boards could also be used to support on-the-fly meetings in which individuals could use electronic pens to sketch out ideas that could then be stored electronically. In such settings they could also be interacted with via wireless handheld computers, allowing information to be ?scraped?Eoff or ?squirted?Eonto the whiteboard.
Awareness Mechanisms ,  | Awareness involves knowing who is around, what is happening, and who is talking with whom (Dourish and Bly, 1992). For example, when we are at a party, we move around the physical space, observing what is going on and who is talking to whom, eavesdropping on others' conversations and passing on gossip to others. A specific kind of awareness is peripheral awareness. This refers to a person's ability to maintain and constantly update a sense of what is going on in the physical and social context, through keeping an eye on what is happening in the periphery of their vision. This might include noting whether people are in a good or bad mood by the way they are talking, how fast the drink and food is being consumed, who has entered or left the room, how long someone has been absent, and whether the lonely guy in the corner is finally talking to someone?all while we are having a conversation with someone else. The combination of direct observations and peripheral monitoring keeps people informed and updated on what is happening in the world.
Awareness Mechanisms ,  | Similar ways of becoming aware and keeping aware take place in other contexts, such as a place of study, at work, or school. Importantly, this requires fathoming when it is an appropriate time to interact with others to get and pass information on. Seeing a professor slam the office door signals to students that this is definitely not a good time to ask for an extension on an assignment deadline. Conversely, seeing teachers with beaming faces, chatting openly to other students suggests they are in a good mood and therefore this would be a good time to ask them if it would be all right to miss next week's seminar because of an important family engagement. The knowledge that someone is approachable or not rapidly spreads through a company, school, or other institution. People are very eager to pass on both good and bad news to others and will go out of their way to gossip, loitering in corridors, hanging around at the photocopier and coffee machine ?spreading the word.?E
Awareness Mechanisms ,  | In addition to monitoring the behavior of others, people will organize their work and physical environment to enable it to be successfully monitored by others. This ranges from the use of subtle cues to more blatant ones. An example of a subtle cue is when someone leaves their dorm or office door slightly ajar to indicate that they can be approached. A more blatant one is the complete closing of their door together with a ?do not disturb?Enotice prominently on it, signaling to everyone that under no circumstances should they be disturbed (see Figure 4.12).
Awareness Mechanisms ,  | Overhearing and Overseeing: People who work closely together also develop various strategies for coordinating their work, based on an up-to-date awareness of what the others are doing. This is especially so for interdependent tasks, where the outcome of one person's activity is needed for others to be able to carry out their tasks. For example, when putting on a show, the performers will constantly monitor what one another is doing in order to coordinate their performance efficiently. The metaphorical expression ?closely-knit teams?Eexemplifies this way of collaborating. People become highly skilled in reading and tracking what others are doing and the information they are attending to. A well-known study of this phenomenon is described by Christian Heath and Paul Luff (1992), who looked at how two controllers worked together in a control room in the London Underground. An overriding observation was that the actions of one controller were tied very closely to what the other was doing. One of the controllers was responsible for the movement of trains on the line (controller A), while the other was responsible for providing information to passengers about the current service (controller B). In many instances, it was found that controller B overheard what controller A was doing and saying, and acted accordingly?even though controller A had not said anything explicitly to him. For example, on overhearing controller A discussing a problem with a train driver over the in-cab intercom system, controller B inferred from the ensuing conversation that there was going to be a disruption to the service and so started announcing this to the passengers on the platform before controller A had even finished talking with the train driver. At other times, the two controllers keep a lookout for each other, monitoring the environment for actions and events which they might have not noticed but may be important for them to know about so that they can act appropriately.
Awareness Mechanisms ,  | Comment: In such circumstances, the person is likely to carry on as normal. In some cases this will result in inappropriate behavior. Repair mechanisms will then need to be set in motion. The knowledgeable participants may notice that the other person has not acted in the manner expected. They may then use one of a number of subtle repair mechanisms, say coughing or glancing at something that needs attending to. If this doesn't work, they may then resort to explicitly stating aloud what had previously been signaled implicitly. Conversely, the unaware participant may wonder why the event hasn't happened and, likewise, look over at the other people, cough to get their attention, or explicitly ask them a question. The kind of repair mechanism employed at a given moment will depend on a number of factors, including the relationship among the participants, e.g. whether one is more senior than the others?this determines who can ask what, the perceived fault or responsibility for the breakdown, and the severity of the outcome of not acting there and then on the new information.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | The various observations about awareness have led system developers to consider how best to provide awareness information for people who need to work together but who are not in the same physical space. Various technologies have been employed, along with the design of specific applications to convey information about what people are doing and the progress of their ongoing work. As mentioned previously, media spaces and audio?video links have been developed to enable remote colleagues to keep in touch with one another. Some of these systems have also been developed to provide awareness information about remote partners, allowing them to find out what one another is doing. One of the earliest systems was Portholes, developed at Xerox PARC research labs (Dourish and Bly, 1992). The system presented regularly-updated digitized video images of people in their offices from a number of different locations (in the USA and UK). These were shown in a matrix display on people's workstations. Clicking on one of the images had the effect of bringing up a dialog box providing further information about that individual, e.g. name, phone number together with a set of lightweight action buttons, e.g. email the person, listen to a prerecorded audio snippet. The system provided changing images of people throughout the day and night in their offices, letting others see at a glance whether they were in their offices, what they were working on, and who was around (see Figure 4.13) . Informal evaluation of the set-up suggested that having access to such information led to a shared sense of community.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Hence, there has been a shift towards supporting a collective ?stream of consciousness?Ethat people can attend to when they want and likewise provide information for whom they want. An example is Elvin, which is a distributed awareness system that provides a range of client services (Segall and Arnold, 1997) . It includes Tickertape, a lightweight messaging system, that shows small color-coded messages scrolling from right to left across a user's screen, together with virtual presence windows, indicating who is online or offline and for how long (see Figure 4.14) . This and other Internet instant messaging systems provide a number of functions, including a chat and local organizing tool for shared events, e.g. lunch dates, and announcements, e.g. a party, and an ?always-on?Ecommunication tool for people working together on projects but who are not physically collocated.

Mental Models ,  | It is assumed that mental models are used by people to reason about a system, and in particular, to try to fathom out what to do when something unexpected happens with the system or when encountering unfamiliar systems. The more someone learns about a system and how it functions, the more their mental model develops. For example, TV engineers have a ?deep?Emental model of how TVs work that allows them to work out how to fix them. In contrast, an average citizen is likely to have a reasonably good mental model of how to operate a TV but a ?shallow?Emental model of how it works. Within cognitive psychology, mental models have been postulated as internal constructions of some aspect of the external world that are manipulated, enabling predictions and inferences to be made (Craik, 1943). This process is thought to involve the ?fleshing out?Eand the ?running?Eof a mental model (Johnson-Laird, 1983). This can involve both unconscious and conscious mental processes, where images and analogies are activated.

Do you turn it to the specified temperature or higher? | Comment: Most people when asked the first question imagine the scenario in terms of what they would do in their own house and choose the first option. A typical explanation is that setting the temperature to be as high as possible increases the rate at which the room warms up. While many people may believe this, it is incorrect. Thermostats work by switching on the heat and keeping it going at a constant speed until the desired temperature set is reached, at which point they cut out. They cannot control the rate at which heat is given out from a heating system. Left at a given setting, thermostats will turn the heat on and off as necessary to maintain the desired temperature.

Some people answer that they would turn the oven to a higher temperature in order to warm it up more quickly. Electric ovens work on the same principle as central heating, and so turning the heat up higher will not warm it up any quicker. There is also the problem of the pizza burning if the oven is too hot!

It seems that in the above scenarios, they are running a mental model based on a general valve theory of the way something works (Kempton, 1986). This assumes the underlying principle of ?more is more:?Ethe more you turn or push something the more it causes the desired effect. This principle holds for a range of physical devices, such as faucets and radio controls, where the more you turn them the more water or volume is given. However, it does not hold for thermostats, which instead function based on the principle of an on?off switch. What seems to happen is that in everyday life people develop a core set of abstractions about how things work, and apply these to a range of devices, irrespective of whether they are appropriate.

Just watch people at a pedestrian crossing or waiting for an elevator. How many times do they press the button? A lot of people will press it at least twice. When asked why a common reason given is that they think it will make the lights change faster or ensure the elevator arrives. This seems to be another example of following the ?more is more?Ephilosophy: it is believed that the more times you press the button the more likely it is to result in the desired effect.

As a consequence, they find it difficult to identify, describe, or solve a problem, and lack the words or concepts to explain what is happening.

Ideally, they should be able to develop a mental model that matches the conceptual model. But to what extent is this realistic given that most people are resistant to spending much time learning about how things work, especially if it involves reading manuals or other documentation? Alternatively, if interactive technologies could be designed to be more transparent, then it might be easier to understand them in terms of how they work and what to do when they don't.

In this situation, the system should be designed to make it obvious what to do and how to use it.

Other users like to understand how the device they are using works in order to make informed decisions about how to carry out their tasks, especially if there are numerous ways of doing something. Some search engines have been designed with this in mind: they provide background information on how they work and how to improve one's searching techniques (see Figure 3.8).

Theory of Action ,  | Interpret the state.: It is important to note that while interaction styles can be specifically geared towards certain action stages, they may do so at the expense of others. For example, while menus are good at helping users form intentions, they can also distract them by providing a range of choices that can lead them astray from their initial intentions. How many times have you changed your mind about what you planned to do based on what catches your eye when browsing a set of menu options or hyperlinks on a website? And, how often have you been tempted to add features like sounds, animations, colors, and fancy backgrounds to a Powerpoint presentation because you happen upon them in the menu options?even though they were not part of your original intention to create a set of slides for a talk? Such reaction-based actions are common, especially for GUI-based interfaces.
Theory of Action ,  | Interpret the state.: Related to the theory of action is the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation (Norman, 1986; Hutchins et al., 1986). The ?gulfs?Eexplicate the gaps that exist between the user and the interface and point to how to design the latter to enable the user to cope with them. The first one?the gulf of execution?describes the distance from the user to the physical system while the second one?the gulf of evaluation?is the distance from the physical system to the user (see Figure 3.9) . Norman and his colleagues suggest that designers and users need to concern themselves with how to bridge the gulfs in order to reduce the cognitive effort required to perform a task. This can be achieved, on the one hand, by designing usable interfaces that match the psychological characteristics of the user, e.g. taking into account their memory limitations, and, on the other hand, by the user learning to create goals, plans, and action sequences that fit with how the interface works.
Theory of Action ,  | Interpret the state.: New conceptual frameworks have also been spawned. Quintana et al. (2000) have used the gulfs as the basis of their learner-centered design (LCD) approach, that has been influential in informing the design of educational applications. They stress the need to bridge the ?gulf of expertise?Ebetween a learner and the domain they are learning about. Bellotti et al. (2002) have also used it as the basis of their ?making sense?Eframework that addresses the new challenges facing designers when developing ubiquitous computing systems.

However, most cognitive activities involve people interacting with external kinds of representations, like books, documents, and computers?not to mention one another. For example, when we go home from wherever we have been we do not need to remember the details of the route because we rely on cues in the environment,
. Within these stages, various pro ,  | e.g. we know to turn left at the red house, right when the road comes to a T-junction, and so on. Similarly, when we are at home we do not have to remember where everything is because information is ?out there.?EWe decide what to eat and drink by scanning the items in the fridge, find out whether any messages have been left by glancing at the answering machine to see if there is a flashing light, and so on. To what extent, therefore, can we say that information processing models are truly representative of everyday cognitive activities? Moreover, do they adequately account for how people interact with computers and other devices?
. Within these stages, various pro ,  | Instead, there has been an increasing trend to study cognitive activities in the context in which they occur, analyzing cognition as it happens "in the wild" (Hutchins, 1995). A central goal has been to look at how structures in the environment can both aid human cognition and reduce cognitive load. Two approaches that have adopted this approach are ?external?Eand ?distributed?Ecognition, which we now turn our attention to.
External Cognition , 1.	Carrying out the sum using pen and paper is easier than doing it in your head because you ?offload?Esome of the computation by writing down partial results and using them to continue with the calculation. Doing the same sum with a calculator is even easier, because it requires only eight simple key presses. Even more of the computation has been offloaded onto the tool. You need only follow a simple internalized procedure (key in first number, then the multiplier sign, then next number, and finally the equals sign) and then read off the result from the external display. | 1.

You need only follow a simple internalized procedure (key in first number, then the multiplier sign, then next number, and finally the equals sign) and then read off the result from the external display.
External Cognition , 2.	Using Roman numerals to do the same sum is much harder: 2 by 3 becomes II ? III, and 234 by 456 becomes CCXXXIIII ? CCC-CXXXXXVI. The first calculation may be possible to do in your head or on a bit of paper, but the second is incredibly difficult to do in your head or even on a piece of paper ( unless you are an expert in using Roman numerals or you ?cheat?Eand transform it into Arabic numerals). Calculators do not have Roman numerals so it would be impossible to do on a calculator. Hence, it is much harder to perform the calculations using Roman numerals than algebraic numerals?even though the problem is equivalent in both conditions. The reason for this is that the two kinds of representation transform the task into one that is easy and one that is more difficult, respectively. The kind of tool used also can change the nature of the task to being more or less easy. | 2.	Using Roman numerals to do the same sum is much harder: 2 by 3 becomes II ?

Distributed Cognition ,  | The distributed cognition approach studies the nature of cognitive phenomena across individuals, artifacts, and internal and external representations (Hutchins, 1995). Typically, it involves describing a ?cognitive system,?Ewhich entails interactions among people, the artifacts they use, and the environment they are working in (see Figure 3.14) . It differs from the external cognition approach in that it provides a more extensive account of the cognitive system.
Distributed Cognition ,  | This way of describing and analyzing a cognitive activity contrasts with other cognitive approaches, e.g. the information processing model, in that it focuses not on what is happening inside the head of an individual, but on what is happening across a system of individuals and artifacts. For example, in the cognitive system of the cockpit, a number of people and artifacts are involved in the activity of ?flying to a higher altitude.?EThe air traffic controller initially tells the co-pilot when it is safe to fly to a higher altitude. The co-pilot then alerts the pilot, who is flying the plane, by moving a knob on the instrument panel in front of them, indicating that it is now safe to fly (see Figure 3.15) . Hence, the information concerning this activity is transformed through different media (over the radio, through the co-pilot, and via a change in the position of an instrument).

seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Many of us now spend a large proportion of our time staring at a computer screen. While focusing on one task at the screen we switch constantly between others, for example, every 5?E0 minutes while writing this chapter I check my email, breaking off sometimes in midsentence to see who has sent me a message and then finding myself diverted to looking at the latest news item or website recommended to me by a colleague. Like nearly everyone else, I am addicted; I can't stop myself from looking.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | I have watched others engaged in ?multi-apping?Eto the point of awe. For example, while attending a talk at a conference I watched a student volunteer in front of me deftly switch between four ongoing instant message chats (one at the conference, one at school, one with friends, one at her part-time job), read, answer, delete, and place all new messages in various folders of her two email accounts, check and scan through a large list of blogs and news feeds?while appearing to listen to the talk, take some notes, google the speaker's background, and open up his publications. When she had a spare moment she played a game of patience. I must say, I felt quite exhausted just watching her for 10 minutes. It was as if she was capable of living in multiple worlds all at the same time while not letting a moment go to waste. But how much did she take in of the talk?
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Moreover, is it possible to pay attention to and not get distracted from the main ongoing activity in our work, e.g. writing an essay, listening to a lecture, when simultaneously engaged in numerous ?back channel?E screen-based activities? Surely there must be some detrimental effects? As noted by Katie Hafner (2005), a technology reporter, "distracting oneself used to consist of sharpening a half-dozen pencils or lighting a cigarette. Today, there is a universe of diversions to buy, hear, watch and forward, which makes focussing on a task all the more challenging."
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Combinations of different media need also to be designed to allow users to recognize the composite information represented in them in the way intended. The use of sound and animation together needs to be coordinated so they happen in a logical sequence. An example of this is the design of lip-synch applications, where the animation of an avatar's or agent's face to make it appear to be talking must be carefully synchronized with the speech that is emitted. A slight delay between the two can make it difficult and disturbing to perceive what is happening?as sometimes happens when film dubbing gets out of synch. A general design principle is that information needs to be represented in an appropriate form to facilitate the perception and recognition of its underlying meaning.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: People often write down what they need to remember on a piece of paper. They also ask others to remind them. Another approach is to use various mental strategies, like mnemonics. A mnemonic involves taking the first letters of a set of words in a phrase or set of concepts and using them to make a more memorable phrase, often using bizarre and idiosyncratic connections. For example, some people have problems working out where east is in relation to west and vice versa, i.e. is it to the left or right. A mnemonic to help figure this out is to take the first letters of the four main points of the compass and then use them in the phrase ?Never Eat Shredded Wheat,?Ementally recited in a clockwise sequence.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: Mark Lansdale and Ernest Edmonds (1992) suggest that it is profitable to view this kind of remembering as involving two memory processes: recall-directed, followed by recognitionbased scanning. The first refers to using memorized information about the required file to get as close to it as possible. The more exact this is the more success the user will have in tracking down the desired file. The second happens when recall has failed to produce what a user wants and so requires reading through a list. To illustrate the difference between these two processes, consider the following scenario: a user is trying to access a couple of websites she visited the week before that compared the selling price of cars offered by different dealers. The user is able to recall the name of one website, ?autobargains.com.?EShe types this in and the website appears. This is an example of successful recall-directed memory. However, the user is unable to remember the name of the second one. She vaguely remembers it was something like
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: ?alwaysthecheapest.com,?Ebut typing this in proves unsuccessful. Instead, she switches to scanning her history list and selects the folder labeled more than six days ago. She notices two or three URLs that could be the one desired at the top of the list, and on the second attempt she finds the website she is looking for. In this situation, the user initially tries recalldirected memory and when this fails, adopts the second strategy of recognition-based scanning?which takes longer but eventually results in success.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: Powerful search engines have gone a long way towards helping people track down the files they want. For example, various search and find tools, such as Apple's Spotlight, enable the user to type a full or partial name or even the first letter of a file that it then searches for in the entire system, including emails, contacts, images, calendars, and applications. Figure 3.5 shows part of a list of 158 files that Spotlight matched to the user's phrase ?cartoon?E prioritized in terms of what the user may be looking for, such as chapters and images.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: Perhaps the best known finding in psychology (certainly the one that nearly all students remember many years after they have finished their studies) is George Miller's (1956) theory that 7?2 chunks of information can be held in short-term memory at any one time. By shortterm memory he meant a memory store in which information was assumed to be processed when first perceived. By chunks he meant a range of items like numbers, letters, or words. According to Miller's theory, therefore, people's immediate memory capacity is very limited. They are able to remember only a few words or numbers that they have heard or seen. If you are not familiar with this phenomenon, try out the following exercise: read the first list below (or get someone to read it to you), cover it up, and then try to recall as many of the items as possible. Repeat this for the other lists. 3 , 12, 6, 20, 9, 4, 0, 1, 19, 8, 97, 13,  84 cat, house, paper, laugh, people, red, yes, number, shadow, broom, rain, plant, lamp, chocolate, radio, one, coin, jet t, k, s, y, r, q, x, p, a, z, l, b, m, e
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: You may be thinking by now, "OK, this is interesting, but what has it got to do with interaction design?" Well, not only does this 50-year-old theory have a special place in psychology, it has also made a big impression in HCI. Unfortunately, however, for the wrong reasons. Many designers have heard or read about this phenomenon and think, ah, here is a bit of psychology I can usefully apply to interface design. Would you agree with them? If so, how might people's ability to only remember 7 ?2 chunks that they have just read or heard be usefully applied to interaction design?
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: All of these are wrong. Why? The simple reason is that these are all items that can be scanned and rescanned visually and hence do not have to be recalled from short-term memory. They don't just flash up on the screen and disappear, requiring the user to remember them before deciding which one to select. If you were asked to find an item of food most people crave in the set of single words listed above, would you have any problem? No, you would just scan the list until you recognized the one (chocolate) that matched the task and then select it?just as people do when interacting with menus, lists, and tabs?regardless of whether they comprise three or 30 items. What the users are required to do here is not remember as many items as possible, having only heard or seen them once in a sequence, but instead scan through a set of items until they recognize the one they want. Quite a different task. Furthermore, there is much more useful psychological research that can be profitably applied to interaction design.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: Many of these are relatively easy to remember and recall as they are very familiar. But consider the last two. How easy is it for someone to come up with such memorable information and then be able to recall it readily? Perhaps the customer can give the address and birthday of another member of their family as a memorable address and date. But what about the request for a password? Suppose a customer selects the word ?interaction?Eas a password?fairly easy to remember. The problem is that the bank operators do not ask for the full password, because of the danger that someone in the vicinity might overhear and write it down. Instead they are instructed to ask the customer to provide specific letters from it, like the seventh followed by the fifth. However, such information does not spring readily to mind. Instead, it requires mentally counting each letter of the password until the desired one is reached. How long does it take you to determine the seventh letter of the password ?interaction?E How did you do it?
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Design Implications: Memory: Learning can be considered in terms of (i) how to use a computer-based application or (ii) using a computer-based application to understand a given topic. Jack Carroll (1990) and his colleagues have written extensively about how to design interfaces to help learners develop computer-based skills. A main observation is that people find it very hard to learn by following a set of instructions in a manual. Instead, they much prefer to ?learn through doing.?EGUIs and direct manipulation interfaces are good environments for supporting this kind of active learning by supporting exploratory interaction and, importantly, allowing users to ?undo?Etheir actions, i.e. return to a previous state if they make a mistake by clicking on the wrong option. Carroll has also suggested that another way of helping learners is by using a ?training-wheels?Eapproach. This involves restricting the possible functions that can be carried out by a novice to the basics and then extending these as the novice becomes more experienced. The underlying rationale is to make initial learning more tractable, helping the learner focus on simple operations before moving on to more complex ones.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Design Implications: Memory: One form of interactivity that has been found to be highly effective is ?dynalinking?E(Rogers and Scaife, 1998) . Abstract representations, such as diagrams, are linked together with a more concrete illustration of what they stand for, such as simulation. Changes in one are matched by changes in the other, enabling a better understanding of what the abstraction means. An example where it has been used is in the design of Pondworld, aimed at helping students learn ecological concepts, e.g. food webs. A concrete simulation showed various organisms swimming and moving around and occasionally an event where one would eat another, e.g. a snail eating the weed. This was annotated and accompanied by various eating sounds,

Anthropomorphism in Interaction Desi ,  | It is well known that people readily attribute human qualities to their pets and their cars, and, conversely, are willing to accept human attributes that have been assigned by others to cartoon characters, robots, and toys. Advertisers are well aware of this phenomenon and often create human-like characters out of inanimate objects to promote their products. For example, breakfast cereals, butter, and fruit drinks have all been transmogrified into characters with human qualities (they move, talk, have personalities, and show emotions), enticing the viewer to buy them. Children are especially susceptible to this kind of ?magic,?Eas witnessed by their love of cartoons, where all manner of inanimate objects are brought to life with human-like qualities.
Anthropomorphism in Interaction Desi ,  | The finding that people, especially children, have a propensity to accept and enjoy objects that have been given human-like qualities has led many designers to capitalize on it, most notably in the design of human?computer dialogs modeled on how humans talk to each other. A range of animated screen characters, such as agents, friends, advisors, and virtual pets, have been developed.
Anthropomorphism in Interaction Desi ,  | Anthropomorphism can also lead people into a false sense of belief, enticing them to confide in agents called ?software bots?Ethat reside in chatrooms and other electronic spaces, pretending to be conversant human beings. Furthermore, children are no longer required to use their imagination when acting out real-life scenarios, e.g. playing doctors and nurses, but can play with dolls that control the play, telling them their wants and dislikes. By far the most common complaint against computers pretending to have human qualities, however, is that people find them very annoying. Once users discover that a system cannot really converse like a human or does not possess real human qualities (like having a personality or being sincere), they become quickly disillusioned and subsequently distrust it. E-commerce sites that pretend to be caring by presenting an assortment of virtual assistants, receptionists, and other such helpers are seen for what they really are?artificial. Children and adults alike also are quickly bored and annoyed with applications that are fronted by artificial screen characters, e.g. tutor wizards, and simply ignore whatever they might suggest.

Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: In the 1980s, the prevailing paradigm in human?computer interaction was how to design user-centered applications for the desktop computer. Questions about what and how to design were framed in terms of specifying the requirements for a single ?user?Einteracting with a screen-based ?interface.?ETask analytic and usability methods were developed based on an individual user's cognitive capabilities. The acronym WIMP was used as one way of characterizing the core features of an interface for a single user: this stood for Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointer. This was later superseded by the GUI (graphical user interface), a term that has stuck with us ever since.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: Within interaction design, many changes took place in the mid- to late 1990s. The WIMP interface with its single thread, discrete event dialog was considered to be unnecessarily limiting, e.g. Jacob, 1996. Instead, many argued that new frameworks, tools, and applications were needed to enable more flexible forms of interaction to take place, having a higher degree of interactivity and parallel input/output exchanges. At the same time, other kinds of non-WIMP interfaces were experimented with. The shift in thinking, together with technological advances, led to a new generation of user?Ecomputer environments, including virtual reality, multimedia, agent interfaces, pen-based interfaces, eye-movement-based interfaces, tangible interfaces, collaborative interfaces, and ubiquitous computing. The effect of moving interaction design ?beyond the desktop?Eresulted in many new challenges, questions, and phenomena being considered. New methods of designing, modeling, and analyzing came to the fore. At the same time, new theories, concepts, and ideas entered the stage. A turn to the ?social,?Ethe ?emotional,?Eand the ?environmental?Ebegan shaping what was studied, how it was studied, and ultimately what was designed. Significantly, one of the main frames of reference?the single user?was replaced by a set of others, including people, places, and context.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: One of the most influential developments that took place was the birth of ubiquitous computing (Weiser, 1991) . A main idea was that the advent of ubiquitous computing (or ?UbiComp?Eas it is commonly known ) would radically change the way people think about and interact with computers. In particular, computers would be designed to be part of the environment, embedded in a variety of everyday objects, devices, and displays (see Figure 6.1) . The idea behind Weiser's vision was that a ubiquitous computing device would enter a person's center of attention when needed and move to the periphery of their attention when not, enabling the person to switch calmly and effortlessly between activities without having to figure out how to use a computer in performing their tasks. In essence, the technology would be unobtrusive and largely disappear into the background. People would be able to get on with their everyday and working lives, interacting with information and communicating and collaborating with others without being distracted or becoming frustrated with technology.
Setting Goals ,  | The main reason for gathering data at all is to glean information about something. For example, you might want to understand how technology fits into normal family life, or you might want to identify which of two icons representing a ?send email?Eaction is easier to use, or you might want to find out whether the redesign you are planning for a hand-held meter reader is along the right lines. There are many different reasons for gathering data, and before beginning it is important to identify specific goals for the particular study. The goals that are set will influence the nature of the data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and also the analysis to be performed. Once the goals have been set, then you can concentrate on what data to look for and what to do with it once it is gathered.
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | It is important not to pre-empt an answer by phrasing a question to suggest that a particular answer is expected. For example, "You seemed to like this use of color?E assumes that this is the case and will probably encourage the interviewee to answer that this is true so as not to offend the interviewer. Children are particularly prone to behave in this way (see Box 7.2 for more on data gathering with children). The body language of the interviewer, for example, whether she is smiling, scowling, looking disapproving, etc., can have a strong influence on whether the interviewee will agree with a question.
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | Children think and react to situations differently from adults. Sitting a 4-year-old child down in a formal interview situation is unlikely to result in anything other than a wall of silence. If children are to be included in your data gathering sessions, then child-friendly methods are needed to make them feel at ease. For example, for very young children of pre-reading or early reading age, data gathering sessions need to rely on images and chat rather than written instructions or questionnaires. Read et al. (2002) have developed a set of ?smileys?Efor use with children in interviews (see Figure 7.1).
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | The appropriate techniques to involve children also depend on the goal of the data gathering session. For example, Guha et al. (2005) work with children as technology design partners. They focus on children between the ages of 7 and 11. They have found that unexpected innovations result when working as an inter-generational team, i.e. adults and children working together. The method they use is called cooperative inquiry (Druin, 2002) and is based on Scandinavian cooperative design practices, participatory design, and contextual inquiry. There are many techniques that can be used in cooperative inquiry, such as sketching ideas and brainstorming, and observational research which has been modified to accommodate children's preferred approaches. For example, the ?mixing ideas?Eapproach (which also works with younger children, aged 5 to 6) involves three stages. In the first stage, each child generates ideas, working one-on-one with an adult. In the second stage, groups of adults and children mix together these ideas. Finally, all the ideas are mixed together to form ?the big idea?E(see Figure 7.2). Guha et al.
Focus Groups ,  | So, can interviewers believe all the responses they get? Are the respondents giving ?the truth?Eor are they simply giving the answers that they think the interviewer wants to hear?
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Questions for an interview may be open or closed. Open questions are best suited to interviews where the goal of the session is exploratory. Closed questions require a list of possible answers, and so they can only be used in a situation where you know the possible answers in advance. It is always possible to have an ?other?Eoption, but the ideal is that this option is not used very often. So whether you choose to use open questions or closed questions depends on what is already known about the topic of investigation and the goal of the interview. An unstructured interview will usually consist entirely of open questions, while a structured interview will usually consist of closed questions. A semi-structured interview may use a combination of both types.
Planning and Conducting an Intervi , 1.	Have you seen Cybelle before? (Explore previous knowledge)last:. Some closed questions that you might ask include: | Interviewer checks box ? Yes ? No ? Don't remember/know
Planning and Conducting an Intervi , 2.	Would you like to find out about intelligent agents from Cybelle? (Explore initial reaction, then explore the response)last:. Some closed questions that you might ask include: | Interviewer checks box ? Yes ? No ? Don't know

Planning and Conducting an Intervi , 3.	Why?last:. Some closed questions that you might ask include: | This is fun/cool: I don't like her ?personality?E
Questionnaires ,  | It can be harder to develop good questionnaire questions compared with structured interview questions because the interviewer is not available to explain them or to clarify any ambiguities. Because of this, it is important that questions are specific; when possible, closed questions should be asked and a range of answers offered, including a ?no opinion?Eor ?none of these?Eoption. Finally, negative questions can be confusing and may lead to the respondents giving false information. Some questionnaire designers use a mixture of negative and positive questions deliberately because it helps to check the users' intentions. In contrast, the designers of QUIS (Box 7.3) (Chin et al., 1988) decided not to mix negative and positive statements because the questionnaire was already complex enough without forcing participants to pay attention to the direction of the argument.
Questionnaires ,  | The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS), developed by the University of Maryland Human?Computer Interaction Laboratory, is one of the most widely used questionnaires for evaluating interfaces (Chin et al., 1988; Shneiderman, 1998a). Although developed for evaluating user satisfaction, it is frequently applied to other aspects of interaction design. An advantage of this questionnaire is that it has gone through many cycles of refinement and has been used for hundreds of evaluation studies, so it is well tried and tested. The questionnaire consists of the following 12 parts that can be used in total or in parts:
Designing the Questionnaire's Stru ,  | Many questionnaires start by asking for basic demographic information, e.g. gender, age, place of birth, and details of relevant experience, e.g. the time or number of years spent using computers, or the level of expertise within the domain under study, etc. This background information is useful for putting the questionnaire responses into context. For example, if two respondents conflict, these different perspectives may be due to their level of experience?a group of people who are using the web for the first time are likely to express different opinions regarding websites to another group with five years of web experience. However, only contextual information that is relevant to the study goal needs to be collected. In the website example above, it is unlikely that the person's shoe size will provide relevant context to their responses!
Designing the Questionnaire's Stru ,  | typography.: Box 7.4 contains an excerpt from a paper questionnaire designed to evaluate users' satisfaction with some specific features of a prototype website for career changers aged 34?E9 years.
Question and Response Format ,  | Check Boxes and Ranges: The range of answers to demographic questionnaires is predictable. Gender, for example, has two options, male or female, so providing the two options and asking respondents to circle a response makes sense for collecting this information (as in Box 7.4) . A similar approach can be adopted if details of age are needed. But since some people do not like to give their exact age, many questionnaires ask respondents to specify their age as a range (see Box 7.4) . A common design error arises when the ranges overlap. For example, specifying two ranges as 15?E0, 20?E5 will cause confusion: which box do people who are 20 years old check? Making the ranges 14?E9, 20?E4 avoids this problem.
Question and Response Format ,  | Check Boxes and Ranges: A frequently asked question about ranges is whether the interval must be equal in all cases. The answer is that it depends on what you want to know. For example, if you want to collect information for the design of an e-commerce site to sell life insurance, the target population is going to be mostly people with jobs in the age range of, say, 21?E5 years. You could, therefore, have just three ranges: under 21, 21?E5, and over 65. In contrast, if you wanted to see how the population's political views varied across the generations, you might be interested in looking at 10-year cohort groups for people over 21, in which case the following ranges would be appropriate: under 21, 22?E1, 32?E1, etc.

Question and Response Format , 3.	Select items for the final questionnaire and reword as necessary to make them clear. | Many questionnaires use seven- or five-point scales and there are also three-point scales. Arguments for the number of points go both ways. Advocates of long scales argue that they help to show discrimination, as advocated by the QUIS team (QUIS has a nine-point scale; Box 7.3 (Chin et al., 1988)). Rating features on an interface is more difficult for most people than, say, selecting among different flavors of ice cream, and when the task is difficult there is evidence to show that people ?hedge their bets.?ERather than selecting the poles of the scales if there is no right or wrong, respondents tend to select values nearer the center. The counter-argument is that people cannot be expected to discern accurately among points on a large scale, so any scale of more than five points is unnecessarily difficult to use.

Online Questionnaires , 6.	Thoroughly pilot test the questionnaire. This may be achieved in four stages: the survey is reviewed by knowledgeable analysts; typical participants complete the survey using a think-aloud protocol (see below); a small version of the study is attempted; a final check to catch small errors is conducted. | Comment: more often from a drop-down menu than from a list of options that are chosen via radio buttons. Alternatively, you may find no difference and that people's opinions are not affected by the widget style used at the interface. Any differences found, of course, may be due to the variation between individual responses rather than being caused by features in the questionnaire design. To tease the effects apart you would need to ask a large number of participants, e.g. in the order of 50?E00, to respond to the questions for each design.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The study goals provide an orienting focus for the formulation of themes. For example, consider a survey to evaluate whether the information displayed on a train travel website is adequate and sufficient. Several of the respondents add comments to the survey suggesting that, as well as the origin and destination stations, the station stops in between should also be displayed. This is a theme relevant to the study goals and would be reported as a main theme. In another part of the survey, under ?further comments?Eyou might notice that several respondents comment that the company's logo is distracting. Although this too is a theme in the data, it is not directly relevant to the study's goals and may be reported only as a minor theme.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Studying the data, focusing on the study goals, and keeping clear records of the analysis as it progresses are important. Box 8.4 and Case study 8.1 describe studies where themes have been identified from qualitative data and reported as a significant part of their results. The results in Box 8.4 were arrived at by immersion in the data; the box for Case study 8.1 illustrates the use of a specific technique for ordering data?the affinity diagram.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The researchers used an approach which allowed them to track important cultural values?in each country they started by visiting a small town, then moved to a city, and then to a larger metropolitan area. In this way, they could initially understand the daily rhythm of life in the country in a manageable context before moving to the more complex situations. They assumed that any patterns which were observed in all three different contexts were likely to be significant. Taking an ethnographic stance, the researchers tried to do everything that native people would normally do. They followed people around and asked lots of questions about what life was like and what people do. Four significant themes (called ?domains?Eby the researchers) were identified from this work: togetherness, media experiences, consumption habits, and life outside of the home.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Togetherness. Family, kinship, and community were found to be very significant in Europe. For example, the importance of the family eating together was a recurrent theme in the interviews and in the team's observations. Other occasions also promote social gatherings, such as sporting events and leisure activities. The researchers noted that sometimes people spend time together simply watching television. They found an emphasis on face-to-face social time throughout their studies, and the willingness of people to expend effort to maintain this ?togetherness.?E
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Media experiences. The researchers found that many different kinds of media play a variety of roles in European life?Eboth consumption and production of content. For example, they found people painting, playing musical instruments, sketching and drawing in nearly every population center they visited.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Life outside of the home. The researchers were struck by the variety of spaces outside the home where people socialized, and by the diversity of behaviors they observed. For example, people talk, flirt, play games, admire, create art, listen to music, eat, dance, swim, walk, and ?hang out?Ein gardens, parks, bars, pubs, cafes, promenades, markets, boulevards, and plazas. How often people frequent these places, and what they do there, changes with age and life stage.
Categorizing Data ,  | Which categories to use is largely determined by the goal of the study. One of its most challenging aspects is determining meaningful categories that are orthogonal?i.e. do not overlap each other in any way. Another is deciding on the appropriate granularity for the categories, e.g. at word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph level; this is also dependent on the goal of the study and the data being analyzed.

Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | Data gathering sessions for interaction design usually result in a lot of data. Analyzing all of that data in any detail would be very time-consuming, and is often not necessary. We have already suggested that themes, patterns and categories can be used to identify areas where detailed analysis is appropriate. Another approach is to use the ?critical incident technique.?E
Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | The critical incident technique is a flexible set of principles that emerged from work carried out in the United States Army Air Forces where the goal was to identify the critical requirements of ?good?Eand ?bad?Eperformance by pilots (Flanagan, 1954). It has two basic principles: "(a) reporting facts regarding behaviour is preferable to the collection of interpretations, ratings and opinions based on general impressions; (b) reporting should be limited to those behaviours which, according to competent observers, make a significant contribution to the activity" (Flanagan, 1954, p. 355). In the interaction design context, the use of well-planned observation sessions as discussed in Chapter 7 satisfies the first principle. The second principle is referring to critical incidents, i.e. incidents which are significant or pivotal to the activity being observed, in either a desirable or an undesirable way.
Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | In interaction design, critical incident analysis has been used in a variety of ways, but the main focus is to identify specific incidents that are significant, and then to focus on these and analyze them in detail, using the rest of the data collected as context to inform their interpretation. These may be identified by the users, through a retrospective discussion of a recent event, or they may be identified by an observer either through studying video footage, or from observation of the event in real time. For example, in an evaluation study a critical incident may be signalled by times when users were obviously stuck?usually marked by a comment, silence, looks of puzzlement, etc. Jurgen Koenemann-Belliveau et al. (1994) used this approach to compare the efficacy of two versions of a Smalltalk programming manual for supporting novice programmers. They examined breakdowns or problems in achieving a programming task and identified possible threats of incidents, and they were able to trace through a sequence of incidents and achieve a more holistic understanding of the problem. For example, they found that they needed to emphasize how objects interact in teaching object-oriented programming.
Looking for Critical Incidents , 3.	When trying to book the cinema tickets by phone she discovered that she needed a credit card which she doesn't have, and so she had to give me the phone! | A good way to start a video analysis is to watch what has been recorded all the way through while writing a high-level narrative of what happens, noting down where in the video there are any potentially interesting events. How you decide which is an interesting event will depend on what is being observed. For example, if you are studying the interruptions that occur in an open plan office, you would include each time a person breaks off from an ongoing activity, e.g. phone rings, someone walks into their cubicle, email arrives. If it is a study of how pairs of students use a collaborative learning tool then activities such as turn-taking, sharing of input device/s, speaking over one another, and ?fighting?Eover shared objects would be appropriate to record.
Grounded Theory ,  | The aim of grounded theory is to develop a theory that fits a set of collected data. By ?theory?Eis meant in this context: "a set of well-developed concepts related through statements of relationship, which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used to explain or predict phenomena" (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). Development of a ?grounded?Etheory progresses through alternating data collection and data analysis: first data is collected and analyzed to identify categories, then that analysis leads to the need for further data collection, which is analyzed, and more data is then collected. Data gathering is hence driven by the emerging theory. This approach continues until no new insights emerge and the theory is well-developed. During this process, the researcher needs to maintain a balance between objectivity and sensitivity. Objectivity is needed to maintain accurate and impartial interpretation of events; sensitivity is required to notice the subtleties in the data and identify relationships between concepts.
Grounded Theory ,  | The thrust of the analysis undertaken is to identify and define the properties and dimensions of relevant categories and then to use these as the basis for constructing a theory. Category identification and definition is achieved by ?coding?Ethe data, i.e. marking it up according to the emerging categories. According to Strauss and Corbin (1998), this coding has three aspects, which are iteratively performed through the cycle of data collection and analysis:
Grounded Theory ,  | Sarker et al. (2001) used the grounded theory approach to develop a model of collaboration in virtual teams. The virtual teams used in the study were made up of students from two universities?one in Canada and one in the United States of America. Each team consisted of four to five members from each university. Each team was given the task of studying a business systems problem, producing a systems design for it, and developing a working prototype. The projects themselves lasted about 14 weeks and a total of 12 teams participated in the study. The team members could communicate directly with each other using various technologies such as email, videoconferencing, telephone, and fax. The main communication channel, however, was Webboard, a collaborative message board tool supporting threaded discussions, email discussions, chat rooms, instant messaging, calendar, whiteboard, blogging, and so on. Using Webboard meant that communication was more public, and could be recorded more easily.

Using these two approaches, the category ?stages of team development?Ewas chosen as the core category for the grounded theory to be built from this data set, and other categories were linked around it. This theory was further elaborated upon through discussions and reading of theory, and evolved into a theory of how virtual teams develop over time.

They studied the introduction and use of digital libraries in four settings over a fouryear period, collecting data from a total of 144 users. Focus groups and interviews were the primary data collection techniques. They concluded that where technology is integrated with the communities and their practice, through an information intermediary, perceptions of empowerment were increased; where technology is deployed within communities, yet with poor design and support, technologies were perceived as complex and threatening; and where technology was designed in isolation from the communities, users were either unaware of the technology or perceived it as complex or threatening.

(2004) used semi-structured interviews and grounded theory to examine how people answer the question "Is this system secure enough for what I want to do now?," in the context of ubiquitous and mobile technologies. This qualitative approach was used to explore the issues before moving on to develop more detailed questions, but their conclusions included suggested design modifications to take this perspective on security into account.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The granularity of analysis varies depending on the activities and cognitive system being observed and the research or design questions being asked. For example, if the goal is to examine how a team of pilots fly a plane?with a view to improving communication between them?then the focus will be on the interactions and communications that take place between them and their instruments, at a fine level of granularity. If the goal is to understand how pilots learn how to fly?with a view to developing new training materials?then the focus will be at a coarser grain of analysis, taking into account the cultural, historical, and learning aspects involved in becoming a pilot.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Ed Hutchins emphasizes that an important part of doing a distributed cognition analysis is to have a deep understanding of the work domain that is being studied. He even recommends, where possible, that the investigators take steps to learn ?the trade?Eunder study and become an accomplished pilot or sailor (as he has done himself in both cases). This can take a team of researchers several months and even years to accomplish and in most cases this is impractical for a research or design team to do.
Distributed Cognition ,  | It is at this point that knowledge of the theory of distributed cognition can help in interpreting and representing the observations of a work setting (see Chapter 3 and Hutchins, 1995). It provides an analytic framework and a set of concepts to describe what is happening at a higher level of abstraction. Problems can be described in terms of the communication pathways that are being hindered or the breakdowns arising due to information not propagating effectively from one representational state to another (see Box 8.7) . The framework can reveal where information is being ?distorted,?Eresulting in poor communication or inefficiency. Conversely, it can show when different technologies and the representations displayed via them are effective at mediating certain work activities and how well they are coordinated.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The cognitive system?Ethe interactions among people, the artifacts they use, and the environment they are working in.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The communicative pathways?Ethe channels by which information is passed between people, e.g. phone, email, physical gesture.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Propagation of representational states?Ehow information is transformed across different media. Media refers to external artifacts (e.g. instruments, maps, paper notes) and internal representations (e.g. human memory). These can be socially mediated (e.g. passing on a message verbally), technologically mediated ( e.g. pressing a key on a computer), or mentally mediated (e.g. reading the time on a clock ).
Distributed Cognition ,  | Ackermann and Halverson's research (Ackermann and Halverson, 2000; Halverson, 2002) has used the distributed cognition framework to understand, at a cognitive level, how call centers work. Call centers have greatly increased during the last 10 years?now fronting many organizations, including banks, computer companies, postal services, and government offices. Their main function is to field phonebased queries, offering help and advice to customers about their products, services, etc.
Distributed Cognition ,  | One of the first things they noted is that call center operators are under a lot of pressure. They need to begin forming their answers within 45?E0 seconds of answering a call. This can be very demanding, given the diversity of questions that can be asked and the round-about way of talking some callers adopt. However, they also observed that many of the queries the operators encounter are similar, enabling the operators to classify them into types and develop ?routines?Efor finding the information needed for a given type. At a finer level of analysis, Ackermann and Halverson decided to focus on the routines. They observed over 300 calls, taped 60 of them, and chose to analyze 10 in detail. The 10 were transcribed, covering the actions taken and the conversations that took place. One example of ?Joan?Eis used in their write up of the study to illustrate what is involved in a typical routine.
Distributed Cognition ,  | To begin, they drew a schematic bird's eye view of Joan's workplace, illustrating the physical set-up (see Figure 8.16) . The figure shows how the different workspaces are related to each other and the various resources that are used during calls. What stands out immediately from the figure is the way the resources are spread out, requiring Joan to walk from her desk to a shared table for every call. While keeping her fit, it also reveals that certain types of information have to be ?carried?Ebetween the different locations.
Activity Theory ,  | Activity theory (AT) is a product of Soviet psychology that explains human behavior in terms of our practical activity with the world. It originated as part of the attempt to produce a Marxist psychology, an enterprise usually associated with Vygotsky (e.g. 1926/1962) and later Leontiev (e.g. 1978, 1989). In the last 20?E0 years, versions of AT have become popular elsewhere, particularly in Scandinavia, Germany, and now growing in the USA and UK. The newer ?versions?Eof AT have been popular in research investigating ?applied?Eproblems, particularly those to do with work, technology, and education.
Activity Theory ,  | Activity theory provides a framework that focuses analysis around the concept of an ?activity?Eand helps to identify tensions between the different elements of the system. For example, Wendy Mackay et al. (2000) analyzed a 4-minute excerpt from a video of users working with a new software tool. They identified 19 shifts in attention between different parts of the tool interface and the task at hand. In fact, some users spent so much time engaged in these shifts that they lost track of their original task. Using the theory helped evaluators to focus on relevant incidents.
Activity Theory ,  | AT outlines two key models: one which outlines what constitutes an ?activity?Eand one which models the mediating role of artifacts.
Activity Theory ,  | The Individual Model: AT models activities in a hierarchical way. At the bottom level are ?operations,?Eroutinized behaviors that require little conscious attention, e.g. rapid typing. At an intermediate level are ?actions,?Ebehavior that is characterized by conscious planning, e.g. producing a glossary. The top level is the activity, and that provides a minimum meaningful context for understanding the individual actions, e.g. writing an essay (see Figure 8.18) . There may be many different operations capable of fulfilling an action, and many actions capable of serving the same activity.
Activity Theory ,  | The Individual Model: Activities can be identified on the basis of the motives that elicit them, actions on the basis of conscious goals that guide them, and operations by the conditions necessary to attain the goals. However, there is an intimate and fluid link between levels. Actions can become operations as they become more automatic and operations can become actions when an operation encounters an obstacle, thus requiring conscious planning. Similarly there is no strict demarcation between action and activity. If ?motive?Echanges then an activity can become an action. It is also important to realize that activities are not self-contained. Activities relate to others while actions may be part of different activities, and so on.
Activity Theory ,  | The Role of Artifacts: Artifacts can be physical, such as a book or a stone, or they can be abstract, such as a system of symbols or a set of rules. Physical artifacts have physical properties that cause humans to respond to them as direct objects to be acted upon. They also embody a set of social practices, their design reflecting a history of particular use. Leontiev describes the process of learning what these inherent properties are as one of ?appropriation,?Esignifying the active nature of the learning that is needed. The kind of learning involved is one of identifying and participating in the activity appropriate to the artifact. Consider an infant learning to feed with a spoon. Leontiev (1981) observed that, at first, the infant carries the spoon to its mouth as though it were handling any other object, not considering the need to hold it horizontal. Over time, with adult guidance, the spoon is shaped in the way it is because of the social practice?the activity?of feeding and, in turn, the infant's task is to learn that relationship?to discover what practice(s) the object embodies. By contrast a spoon dropped into the cage of a mouse, say, will only ever have the status of just another physical object?no different from that of a stone.
Activity Theory ,  | The Role of Artifacts: The idea of abstract artifacts follows from the idea of ?mediation,?Ei.e. a fundamental characteristic of human development is the change from a direct mode of acting on the world to one that is mediated by something else. In AT, the artifacts involved in an activity mediate between the elements of it.
Activity Theory , 1996) , have widened the focus from the ?individual?Etriangle of a single activity (subject, activity, and object) to include supra-individual concepts?tools, rules, community, and division of labor. By tool is meant the artifacts, signs, and means that mediate the subject and object; by community is meant those who share the same object; by rules is meant a set of agreed conventions and policies covering what it means to be a member of that community (set by laws, parents, managers, boards, etc.); and by division of labor is meant the primary means of classifying the labor in a workplace, e.g. manager, engineer, receptionist.

The conceptual model (Figure 8.18)  is the main framework that is used to describe levels within an activity. This means that identifying elements will be highly dependent on individual interpretation. Christiansen (1996, p. 177) summarizes: "Methodologically?Ethe ideal data for an application of AT consist of longitudinal ethnographic observation, interviews and discussion in real-life settings, supplemented by experiments." She continues that you "cannot interview people directly through rote questions but must interpret their actions and opinions after some careful reflection," which is a difficult process. Nevertheless, the original and later versions of the AT framework have become popular amongst researchers and some practitioners as a way of identifying needs for new tools and to analyze problems that are present in a work or other setting.

However, equally, programming a module could be viewed as an activity?if that was the object of the subject (person).

The primary method of data collection was through interview: 32 employees were interviewed for one to one-and-a-half hours each. The interviews were transcribed and documented with notes and artifacts produced by the interviewees during the conversation. These were then annotated in terms of particular elements of the activity system, e.g. rules, object.

What is Involved in Interaction Desi ,  | The previous chapters have introduced you to many exciting ideas, approaches, theories, and opinions about interaction design, but what does it mean to actually ?do?Einteraction design? The following activity is intended to start you thinking about this by asking you to produce an initial design for an interactive product.
What is Involved in Interaction Desi , 3.	The first thing that came into my head when I started doing this was the myriad of resources I currently use to plan my travel. For example, travel agents will arrange accommodation, visas, guided tours, etc., for me; I can look at paper-based or electronic timetables for journey routes and times, ring up automated timetable readers, operators who will give me travel advice, embassies who will also give me travel advice about their own country, websites to identify cheap flights, and so on. There is a long list. I then thought it would be good to combine the advantages of all of these into one system that could then be tailored to me. For example, so that the first airline offered for any flights is my favorite airline, and the starting point for my journeys is defaulted to my normal train station or airport. The next thing I focused on was the dialog I would have with the system. Hence, my sketches focus on questions the system might ask me and my responses. One of the things that occurred to me as I was producing this sketch is that the location I need to enter will depend on the kind of transport I choose, and the kind of help I need will also depend on the kind of transport I want to use. On the other hand, I would want the system to know that I am unlikely to want to drive in my car to Hong Kong, which is several thousand miles away, so it should automatically default to travel by air for some destinations, and similarly if there is no airport near a destination then it should know that I would not want to fly. | The ?look and feel?Eseemed very bland, and I then realized that I had been subconsciously focusing on business travel, which usually is about getting to and from a given location in the most convenient and comfortable manner; I am unlikely to be concerned about the location itself as I don't have a choice of destination. However, if I was planning travel for a holiday I am more likely to want pictures of the destination and descriptions of local activities, restaurants, historic sites, and so on. I might also want to enter my choices in a different way, focusing on the kind of holiday or location I want to travel to, and leaving the system to suggest alternatives. This led me to reconsider (although not redraw) my ideas.

Interaction design also involves these activities, and in addition we focus attention very clearly on users and their goals. For example, we investigate the artifact's use and target domain by taking a user-centered approach to development, we seek users' opinions and reactions to early designs, and we involve users appropriately in the development process itself. This means that users' concerns direct the development rather than just technical concerns, and for interaction design, the three fundamental activities of design listed above are extended to include an activity of producing a version of the design that users can interact with.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | The description above emphasizes the need to involve users in interaction design, but why is it important? In the past, developers would often talk to managers or to ?proxy users,?Ei.e. people who roleplayed as users, when eliciting requirements. While a proxy user can provide useful information, they will not have the same perspective as someone who performs the task every day, or who will use the intended product on a regular basis. For example, several years ago, I was involved with a system to process and record financial transactions from the foreign exchange (?forex?E dealers in a large international bank. The users of this system took the handwritten transaction records completed by the ?forex?Edealers and entered the details into the system. The system then validated the transaction and communicated a confirmation to the relevant parties. When the requirements for this system were developed, no-one from the development team spoke to the end-users of the system; the requirements were identified by higher-level managers. Although the system was successfully used to support the task, the end-users had developed several ?work-arounds.?EFor example, the system required both buyer code and buyer name to be entered, but it was quite common for the dealers to write only the buyer name on their transaction chitty. It would have been simple to design the system to support entry of transactions based on names or codes, but this wasn't done?both fields were required. This wasted a lot of time as the users had to identify the codes manually.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | Expectation management is the process of making sure that the users' views and expectations of the new product are realistic. The purpose of expectation management is to ensure that there are no surprises for users when the product arrives. If users feel they have been ?cheated?Eby promises that have not been fulfilled, then this will cause resistance and maybe rejection. Expectation management is relevant whether you are dealing with an organization introducing a new software system or a company developing a new interactive toy. In both cases, the marketing of the new arrival must be careful not to misrepresent the product. How many times have you seen an advert for something you thought would be really good to have, but when you see one, discover that the marketing ?hype?Ewas a little exaggerated? I expect you felt quite disappointed and let down. Well, this is the kind of feeling that expectation management tries to avoid.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | A second reason for user involvement is ownership. Users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product's development are more likely to feel a sense of ?ownership?Etowards it and be receptive to it when it finally emerges.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | One of the reasons often cited for not involving users in development is the amount of time it takes to organize, manage, and control such involvement. This issue may appear particularly acute in developing systems to run on the Internet, where ever-shorter timescales are being forced on teams?in this fastmoving area, projects lasting three months or less are common. You might think, therefore, that it would be particularly difficult to involve users in such projects. However, Braiterman et al. (2000) report two case studies showing how to involve users successfully in large-scale but very short multidisciplinary projects, belying the claim that involving users can waste valuable development time.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Microsoft bases feature selection and prioritization on a technique called ?activity-based planning.?EThis technique involves studying what users do to achieve a certain activity like writing a letter, and using the results of the study to choose product features. Each new release of a software product is limited to supporting about four new major activities. Each of these proposed new activities can be broken down into sub-activities, and these mapped against features already existing in the software. Any new features required are noted. If a feature can support more than one activity, then it is placed higher in the priority list. The techniques used to gather customer data for activity-based planning do not appear to be prescribed in any way, and can vary from visiting customers through to asking them to use an instrumented version of the software, i.e. a version that records the actions they take. Microsoft also employs contextual inquiry (see chapter 10)  to learn about their customers' work, although they find that it can be time-consuming and the results ambiguous.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Because the world of applications software changes so rapidly, developers need to continually observe and test with users. Throughout the development phase, usability tests are carried out in Microsoft's usability lab. Each time a developer believes that a feature is finished, then it is scheduled for testing in the usability lab. A group of about 10 users ?off the street?Eare invited into the lab to perform certain tasks, while their behavior is observed and their performance recorded. The data is then analyzed and the findings fed back into development. This results in thorough testing of all features. As an example, an early version of Office 4.0 went through over 8000 hours of usability testing.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Development was divided into a number of areas, each with its own project team and its own schedule. Consistency across the areas was maintained through the development of a GUI interface standard style guide that ensured all systems had the same look and feel (style guides are discussed in Chapter 6). Users were involved in development on a number of different levels, typically 30?E0% of their time. For example, in one area (Area E), one user was appointed full-time to manage the project team, two others joined the project team part-time for a limited period (about 18 months each), one user was consulted on a regular basis, and a wider set of users were involved through workshops and prototyping sessions. The project team also included technically trained analysts and developers.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): On the other hand, Heinbokel et al. (1996) suggest that a high user involvement has some negative effects. They found that projects with high user participation showed lower overall success, fewer innovations, a lower degree of flexibility, and low team effectiveness, although these effects were noticeable only later in the project (at least 6?E2 months into the project). In short, projects with a high level of user participation tended to run less smoothly. They identified four issues related to communication among users and developers that they suggest caused problems. First, as the project progressed, users developed more sophisticated ideas, and they wanted them to be incorporated late in the project. Second, users were fearful of job losses or worsening job conditions and this led to a tendency for participation to be not constructive. Third, users were unpredictable and not always sympathetic to software development matters. For example, they asked for significant changes to be made just as testing was due to start. Fourth, user orientation in the designers may lead to higher aspirations and hence higher levels of stress.

This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of ?design, test, measure, and redesign?Ebeing repeated as often as necessary. | 3.	Iterative design.

In fact, they comment in their paper how ?obvious?Ethese principles are, and remark that when they started recommending these to designers, the designers' reactions implied that these principles were indeed obvious. However, when they asked designers at a human factors symposium for the major steps in software design, most of them did not cite most of the principles?in fact, only 2% mentioned all of them.

The Olympic Messaging System (OMS) (Gould et al., 1987) was the first reported large computer-based system to be developed using these three principles. Here a combination of techniques was used to elicit users' reactions to designs, from the earliest prototypes through to the final product. In this case, users were mainly involved in evaluating designs. The OMS is discussed further in Chapter 12.

What is a User-Centered Approach? , 5.	All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment. This does not necessarily mean that users are actively involved in design decisions. In her interview at the end of this chapter, Gillian Crampton Smith points out that it is not a good idea for users to be designers. As long as designers remain aware of the users while making their decisions, then this principle will be upheld. Keeping this context in mind can be difficult, but an easily accessible collection of gathered data is one way to achieve this. Some design teams set up a specific design room for the project where data and informal records of brainstorming sessions are pinned on the walls or left on the table. | Comment: To address the first three principles, you would need to find out about potential users of the site. As this is a new site, there is no immediate set of users to consult. However, the tasks and goals, behavior, and characteristics of potential users of this site can be identified by investigating how people shop in existing online and physical shopping situations?for example, shopping through interactive television, through other online sites, in a garden center, in the local corner shop, and so on. For each of these, you will find advantages and disadvantages to the shopping environment and you will observe different behaviors. By looking at behavior and patterns in a physical garden center, you can find out a lot about who might be interested in buying plants, how these people choose plants, what criteria are important, and what their buying habits are. From existing online shopping behavior, you could determine likely contexts of use for the new site. There may be occasions when online shopping behavior conflicts with physical shopping behavior, e.g. someone in the garden center likes to smell the flowers before buying their seeds, while online decisions are based upon the descriptions and pictures of the plants. In this case, as a designer you will need to interpret your findings to create a suitable balance, and evaluate any solution you suggest.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Four basic activities for interaction design were introduced in Chapter 1, some of which you will have engaged in when doing Activity 9.1. These are: identifying needs and establishing requirements for the user experience, developing alternative designs that meet those requirements, building interactive versions of the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed, and evaluating what is being built throughout the process and the user experience it offers. They are fairly generic activities and can be found in other design disciplines too. For example, in architectural design (RIBA[2], 1988) basic requirements are established in a work stage called ?inception,?Ealternative design options are considered in a ?feasibility?Estage, and ?the brief is developed through outline proposals and scheme design. During this time, prototypes may be built or perspectives may be drawn to give clients a better indication of the design being developed. Detail design specifies all components, and working drawings are produced. Finally, the job arrives on site and building commences.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Interaction design involves designing interactive products. The most sensible way for users to evaluate such designs, then, is to interact with them. This requires an interactive version of the designs to be built, but that does not mean a software version is required. There are different techniques for achieving ?interaction,?Enot all of which require a working piece of software. For example, paper-based prototypes are very quick and cheap to build and are very effective for identifying problems in the early stages of design, and through role-playing users can get a real sense of what it will be like to interact with the product. This aspect is also covered in Chapter 11.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Evaluation is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design that is measured in terms of a variety of criteria including the number of errors users make using it, how appealing it is, how well it matches the requirements, and so on. Interaction design requires a high level of user involvement throughout development, and this enhances the chances of an acceptable product being delivered. In most design situations you will find a number of activities concerned with quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is ?fit-for-purpose.?EEvaluation does not replace these activities, but complements and enhances them. We devote Chapters 12 to 15 to the important subject of evaluation.

Think for a minute about what you use in a typical day: cell phone, computer, personal organizer, remote control, soft drink machine, coffee machine, ATM, ticket machine, library information system, the web, photocopier, watch, printer, stereo, calculator, video game.. . the list is endless. Now think for a minute about how usable they are|
,  | How many are actually easy, effortless, and enjoyable to use? All of them, several, or just one or two? This list is probably considerably shorter. Why is this so? Think about when some device caused you considerable grief-how much time did you waste trying to get it to work? Two well-known interactive devices that cause numerous people immense grief are the photocopier that doesn't copy the way they want and the VCR that records a different program from the one they thought they had set or none at all. Why do you think these things happen time and time again? Moreover, can anything be done about it? Many products that require users to interact with them to carry out their tasks (e.g., buying a ticket online from the web, photocopying an article, pre-recording a TV program) have not necessarily been designed with the users in mind. Typically, they have been engineered as systems to perform set functions. While they may work effectively from an engineering perspective, it is often at the expense of how the system will be used by real people. The aim of interaction design is to redress this concern by |

, last: | By interaction design, we mean
,  | designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.
,  | Put another way, it is about creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact. More generally, Winograd (1997, p. 160) describes it as "designing spaces for human communication and interaction." Thackara views it as "the why as well as the how of our daily interactions using computers" (2001, p. 50).
,  | A number of terms have been used to emphasize different aspects of what is being designed, including user interface design, software design, user-centered design, product design, web design, experience design, and interactive system design. Interaction design is increasingly being accepted as the umbrella term, covering all of these aspects. Indeed, many practitioners and designers, who ten years ago would have described what they were doing as interface design or interactive system design, now promote what they are doing as interaction design.
,  | The focus of interaction design is very much concerned with practice, i.e. how to design user experiences. It is not wedded to a particular way of doing design, but is more eclectic, promoting the use of a range of methods, techniques, and frameworks. Some interaction designers have since begun to put forward their own perspective, for example, Cooper and
,  | Reiman (2003) present their take on interaction design as ?goal-directed? and Lowgren and Stolterman (2004) as ?thoughtful.?
,  | How does interaction design differ from other approaches to the design of computer-based systems, such as software engineering? A simple analogy to another profession, concerned with creating buildings, may clarify this difference. In his account of interaction design, Terry Winograd asks how architects and civil engineers differ when faced with the problem of building a house. Architects are concerned with the people and their interactions with each other and with the house being built. For example, is there the right mix of family and private spaces? Are the spaces for cooking and eating in close proximity? Will people live in the space being designed in the way it was intended to be used? In contrast, engineers are interested in issues to do with realizing the project. These include practical concerns like cost, durability, structural aspects, environmental aspects, fire regulations, and construction methods. Just as there is a difference between designing and building a house, so too is there a distinction between designing an interactive product and engineering the software for it.

Who is Involved in Interaction Des ,  | One of the benefits of bringing together people with different backgrounds and training is the potential of many more ideas being generated, new methods developed, and more creative and original designs being produced. However, the down side is the costs involved. The more people there are with different backgrounds in a design team, the more difficult it can be to communicate and progress forward the designs being generated. Why? People with different backgrounds have different perspectives and ways of seeing and talking about the world (see Figure 1.5) . What one person values as important others may not even see (Kim, 1990). Similarly, a computer scientist's understanding of the term ?representation? is often very different from a graphic designer's or a psychologist's.
Who is Involved in Interaction Des ,  | What this means in practice is that confusion, misunderstanding, and communication breakdowns can surface in a team. The various team members may have different ways of talking about design and may use the same terms to mean quite different things. Other problems can arise when a group of people is ?thrown? together who have not worked as a team. For example, the Philips Vision of the Future Project found that its multidisciplinary teams?who were responsible for developing ideas and products for the future? experienced a number of difficulties, namely, that project team members did not always have a clear idea of who needed what information, when, and in what form (Lambourne et al., 1997).
Interaction Design Consultants ,  | ?crit? in which a detailed review of the usability and design of the product is given (for more on expert evaluation, see Chapter 15) . More extensively, it can involve helping clients create their products.
Examples of Best Practice ,  | The Star Interface (Based on Miller and Johnson, 1996 and Smith et al., 1982) Another classic of its time was the 8010 ?Star? system, developed by Xerox in 1981, that revolutionized the way interfaces were designed for personal computing. Like VisiCalc, it received great acclaim but was not commercially successful, and lo and behold many aspects of its conceptual model were borrowed and adapted by other companies, such as Apple and Microsoft, that later appeared in their very successful Mac and Windows products.
Examples of Best Practice ,  | Star was designed as an office system, targeted at workers not interested in computing per se. An important consideration was to make the computer as ?invisible? to the users as possible and to design applications that were suitable for them. The Star developers spent several person-years at the beginning of the project working out an appropriate conceptual model for such an office system. In the end they selected a conceptual model based on an analogy to a physical office. They wanted office workers to imagine the computer to be like an office environment, by acting on electronic counterparts of physical objects in the real world. Their assumption was that this would simplify and clarify the electronic world, making it seem more familiar, less alien, and easier to learn (see Figure 2.4).
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | An interface metaphor is considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. It provides a structure that is similar in some way to aspects of a familiar entity (or entities) but that also has its own behaviors and properties. Consider the term search engine. It has been designed to invite comparison with a common object?a mechanical engine with several parts working?together with an everyday action?searching by looking through numerous files in many different places to extract relevant information. The functions supported by a search engine also include other features besides those belonging to an engine that searches, such as listing and prioritizing the results of a search. It also does these actions in quite different ways from how a mechanical engine works or how a human being might search a library for books on a given topic. The similarities implied by the use of the term ?search engine,? therefore, are at a general level. They are meant to conjure up the essence of the process of finding relevant information, enabling the user to link these to less familiar aspects of the functionality provided.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | As names for describing specific operations, e.g. ?cut? and ?paste? commands for deleting and copying objects (analogy taken from the media industry).
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Comment: Metaphorically-based commands used in Unix, like ?lint? and ?pipe,? have very concrete meanings in everyday language that, when used in the context of the Unix operating system, metaphorically represent some aspect of the operations they refer to. Although their meaning may appear obscure, especially to the novice, they make sense when understood in the context of programming. For example, Unix allows the programmer to send the output of one program to another by using the pipe | symbol. Once explained, it is easy to imagine the output from one container going to another via a pipe.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Two are:: Conflicts with design principles. By trying to design the interface metaphor to fit in with the constraints of the physical world, designers are forced into making bad design solutions that conflict with basic design principles. Ted Nelson used the trashcan as an example of such violation: "a hideous failure of consistency is the garbage can on the Macintosh, which means either ?destroy this? or ?eject it for safekeeping?" (Nelson, 1990). The trashcan has now been designed to transform into an abstract ?eject? icon on the Mac when an icon of an external drive, disk, or memory stick is selected from the desktop and moved towards it, thereby reducing the ambiguity associated with the original metaphor.
Interface Metaphors and Analogies ,  | Two are:: Limits the designer's imagination in conjuring up new paradigms and models. Designers may fixate on ?tired? ideas, based on well-known technologies, that they know people are very familiar with. Nelson points out that one of the dangers of always looking backwards is that it prevents the designer from thinking of new functionality to provide. For example, Gentner and Nielsen (1996) discuss how they used a book metaphor for designing the user interface to Sun Microsystems' online documentation. In hindsight they realized how it had blinkered them in organizing the online material, preventing them from
Interaction Types , 4.	Exploring?where users move through a virtual environment or a physical space. Virtual environments include 3D worlds and virtual reality systems. They enable users to hone in on their familiar knowledge of physically moving around. Physical spaces that use sensor-based technologies include smart rooms and ambient environments, also enabling people to capitalize on familiarity. | Conversing: A main benefit of developing a conceptual model that uses a conversational style of interaction is that it allows people, especially novices, to interact with a system in a way that is familiar to them. For example, the search engine ?Ask Jeeves for Kids!? allows children to ask a question in a way they would when asking their teachers or parents?rather than making them reformulate their question in terms of keywords and Boolean logic. Similarly, the generation of virtual representatives that have been incorporated into online store websites offer customers quick and direct answers to their product-related queries. An example is Anna, whose appearance was commented upon in the last chapter. She is a semi-cartoon character fronting the Swedish furniture store Ikea's Help center

Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Manipulating: What might be the advantages of using a physical?digital form of manipulation? One of the main benefits, when used in this context, is to encourage creativity and playfulness. In a study exploring color mixing, it was found that young children (aged 4?6 years) were far more creative, collaborative, and reflective when mixing colors with the physical?digital cubes compared with mixing digital colored disks as part of software applications (Rogers et al., 2002a). In particular, they explored many more combinations and tried to see if they could change the density of the colors being mixed, for example, by placing the cubes on top of each other and pressing them hard on the table.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Manipulating: The MIT Media Lab has also developed a new generation of digital manipulatives? computationallyenhanced physical artifacts (see Figure 2.9) . One form of manipulative?the Cricket?comprises a tiny microchip processor, that is capable of two-way infrared communication and controlling motors and sensors (Resnick et al., 1998). Crickets can be programmed and combined with physical artifacts, sensors, and motors to enable students to explore programming concepts in novel physical ways.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Manipulating: Apple Computer Inc. was one of the first computer companies to design an operating environment that used direct manipulation as its central mode of interaction. The highly successful Macintosh desktop demonstrates the main principles of direct manipulation (see Figure 2.10) . One of their assumptions was that people expect their physical actions to have physical results, so when a drawing tool is used, a corresponding line should appear and when a file is placed in the trashcan, a corresponding sound or visual cue showing it has been successfully thrown away is used (Apple Computer Inc., 1987). A number of visual and auditory cues was used to provide such feedback, including various animations and sounds, e.g. shrinking and expanding icons accompanied with ?shhhlicc? and ?crouik? sounds to represent opening and closing of files). Much of the interaction design was geared towards providing clues to the user to know what to do, to feel comfortable, and to enjoy exploring the interface. More recent Mac interfaces follow the same principles, but have become more colorful, use more animation, and provide more detailed icons that have a 3D perspective.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Manipulating: Many applications have been developed based on some form of direct manipulation, e.g. wordprocessing packages, video games, learning tools, and image editing tools. However, while direct manipulation interfaces provide a very versatile mode of interaction they do have their drawbacks. In particular, not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be undertaken directly. Some tasks are also better achieved through issuing commands. For example, consider how you edit an essay using a wordprocessor. Suppose you had referenced work by Ben Shneiderman but had spelled his name as Schneiderman, with an extra ?c? throughout the essay. How would you correct this error using a direct manipulation interface? You would need to read through your essay and manually select the ?c? in every ?Schneiderman,? highlighting and then deleting it. This would be very tedious and it would be easy to miss one or two. By contrast, this operation is relatively effortless and also likely to
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Manipulating: be more accurate when using a command-based interaction. All you need to do is instruct the wordprocessor to find every ?Schneiderman? and replace it with ?Shneiderman.? This can be done through selecting a menu option or using a combination of command keys and then typing the changes required into the dialog box that pops up.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Exploring: A number of physical environments have been developed in which are embedded sensor technologies and other location-detection technologies. They are often called context-aware environments: the location and/or presence of people in the vicinity of a sensing device is detected and based on this, the environment decides which digital information to provide on a device, e.g. a PDA, or which action to perform, e.g. changing lights in a room, that is considered relevant or useful to the person at a particular time and place. For example, a number of electronic tourist guides have been developed that run on mobile devices, e.g. PDAs and cell phones equipped with GPS, that provide information about restaurants, historical buildings, and other places of interest as the tourist wanders near them in an unfamiliar city (Cheverst et al., 2000). Physically embedded environments have also been designed to extend how children learn. For example, the Ambient Wood project was designed as an outdoor learning experience where a physical woodland was wired to present various forms of digital information to children, as they moved around it (Rogers et al., 2005). Depending on which part of the woodland they passed by, e.g. a particular kind of tree, a bush, a hole, an image would occasionally pop up on a PDA they were carrying, or a sound was played via hidden speakers or heard through a special handheld audio device? the ambient horn (see Figure 2.14) . The idea was to provide contextually-relevant digital information that would enhance the ?usual? physical experience available to children when exploring an outdoor world.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Exploring: temperature, human presence, and aspects of the occupant's behavior, e.g. the occupant's routines and deviations. The idea behind the design of smart homes is that through using the various data collected and/or monitored, contextually relevant forms of digital information can be provided to the occupants or others, e.g. caregivers, family members, at appropriate times in different parts of the house or other places. A few, much publicized, smart homes were built based on this philosophy, including the ?Aware Home? in the USA (Abowd et al., 2000) , the ?Ubiquitous Home? in Japan (Yamazake, 2005), and the ?Orange-at-Home? in the UK (Harper, 2003) . Living experiments were subsequently conducted to see how real families would respond and adapt to such a set-up, over a period of several months. Activity 2.7
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Comment: Advocates of the agent approach, e.g. Nicholas Negroponte claim it can be much more versatile than direct manipulation or command-based interfaces, allowing users to do what they want to do through delegating the boring and time-consuming tasks to an agent. Negroponte uses the analogy of a well-trained English butler who answers the phone, tends to a person's needs, fends off callers, and tells ?white lies? if necessary on his master's behalf. Similarly, a digital butler is designed to read a user's email and flag the important ones, scout the web and newsgroups for interesting information, screen unwanted electronic intrusions, and so on. This approach assumes that people like to delegate work to others rather than directly interact with computers themselves.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Comment: Advocates of the direct manipulation approach, e.g. Ben Shneiderman, suggest that it is preferable because it allows users to enjoy mastery and being in control. People like to know what is going on, be involved in the action, and have a sense of power over the computer? all of which direct manipulation interfaces support.
Interaction Types , 1, car insurance press 2, travel insurance press 3, health insurance press 4, other press 5" | Comment: ?presence,? ?states,? and ?levels? being detected, e.g. emotional state, state of learning, information needs, when using sensing and tracking technologies. Instead of the user controlling an input device to interact with a computer, the ubiquitous environment has to detect the location of someone and determine what information, e.g. a sound, a message, an image, to present via a personal display, e.g. cell phone, PDA, or public display, e.g. a wall display, speakers.
Theories, Models, and Frameworks ,  | Models. Models are typically abstracted from a theory coming from a contributing discipline, e.g. psychology, that can be directly applied to interaction design. For example, Norman (1988) developed a number of models of user interaction based on theories of cognitive processing arising out of cognitive science, that were intended to explain the way users interacted with interactive technologies. These include his cyclical seven stages of action model (see Chapter 3) ? that describes how users move from their plans to executing physical actions they need to perform to achieve them, to evaluating the outcome of their actions with respect to their goals. Another highly influential model based on cognitive theory that made its mark in the 1980s was Card, Moran, and Newell's keystroke model (see Chapters 3 and 15). This was used by a number of researchers and designers as a predictive way of analyzing user performance for different interfaces to determine which would be the most effective. More recent models developed in interaction design are user models, that predict what information users want in their interactions, and models that characterize core components of the user experience, such as Norman's (2004) model of emotional design (Chapter 5).
Frustrating Interfaces and Negative  ,  | This does not mean that developers are unaware of such usability problems. Several methods have been devised to help the novice user get set up and become familiarized with a technology. However, these have sometimes backfired, since the design solution itself has ironically become a source of annoyance and frustration. For example, one technique that was popularized in the 1990s was the use of friendly agents at the interface. The assumption was that novices would feel more at ease with a ?companion? and would be encouraged to try things out, after listening, watching, following, and interacting with it. Microsoft pioneered a class of agent-based software, Bob, aimed at new computer users (many of whom were viewed as computer-phobic). The agents were presented as friendly characters, including a pet dog and a cute bunny. An underlying assumption was that having these kinds of agents on the screen would make users feel more comfortable with using the software. An interface metaphor of a warm, cozy living room, replete with fire and furniture, was also provided (see Figure 5.5) ? again intended to convey a comfortable feeling.

Frustrating Interfaces and Negative  ,  | Contrary to the designer's expectations, many people did not like the idea of Bob at all, finding the interface too cute and childish. However, Microsoft did not give up on the idea of making their interfaces more friendly and developed other kinds of agents, including the infamous ?Clippy? (a paper clip that has human-like qualities), as part of their Windows 98 operating environment.[1] Clippy typically appeared at the bottom of a user's screen whenever the system ?thought? the user needed help carrying out a particular task (see Figure 5.6) . It, too, was depicted as a cartoon character, with a warm personality. This time, Clippy was released as a commercial product but it was not a success. Many Microsoft users found it very trying and intrusive, distracting them from their work. When it was finally retired, numerous websites posted jokes and witty comments, celebrating its demise.

Frustrating Interfaces and Negative  , 2.	Error messages | Error messages have a long history in computer interface design, and are notorious for their incomprehensibility. For example, Nielsen (1993) describes an early system that was developed, allowing only for one line of error messages. Whenever the error message was too long, the system truncated it to fit on the line, which the users would spend a long time trying to decipher. The full message was available only by pressing the PF1 (help key) function key. While this may have seemed like a natural design solution to the developers, it was not at all obvious to the users. A much better design solution would have been to use the one line of the screen to indicate how to find more information about the current error? "press the PF1 key for explanation".

Showing an icon whirring around and the word ?loading? with a slow percentage bar increasing on the splash page can be off-putting, unless the user expects or knows that something good is going to appear. Links that hang and eventually do not load can also be very annoying.
Expressive Interfaces and Positive E ,  | One of the benefits of using expressive embellishments is that they provide reassuring feedback to the user that can be both informative and fun. They can, however, sometimes have the opposite effect on people, who find them intrusive, causing them at times to get annoyed and even angry. This is especially so for ?cutesy? looking ones. How enjoyable they are perceived to be varies considerably across cultures. In South Korea and Japan, for example, cute cartoon characters such as those depicted in Manga comics have huge cult followings. Moreover, their influence has become widespread in the design of websites, video games, cell phone skins, etc. These include the use of large-eyed creatures such as those used in Pokemon and Pikachu games, and bright colors and pastels (Marcus, 2002).

Expressive Interfaces and Positive E ,  | Open table as spreadsheet: The style of an interface, in terms of the shapes, fonts, colors, balance, white space, and graphical elements that are used and the way they are combined, can also influence its affectiveness. Use of imagery at the interface can result in more engaging and enjoyable experiences (Mullet and Sano, 1995). Until recently, however, the focus of HCI was primarily on usability, with scant attention being paid to the design of aesthetically pleasing interfaces. Empirical studies showing that the aesthetics of an interface can have a positive effect on people's perception of the system's usability (Tractinsky, 1997, 2000) have begun to change that, and the importance of aesthetics is gaining acceptance within the HCI community. When the ?look and feel? of an interface is pleasing, e.g. beautiful graphics, nice feel to the way the elements have been put together, well-designed fonts, elegant use of images and color, a good sense of balance, users are likely to be more tolerant, e.g. they may be prepared to wait a few more seconds for a website to download. Furthermore, good-looking interfaces are often more satisfying and pleasurable to use. A key concern, therefore, is to strike a balance between designing pleasurable and usable interfaces (Tractinsky et al., 2000).
Expressive Interfaces and Positive E ,  | Comment: Aaron Marcus, a graphic designer, created the two designs in an attempt to provide appealing interfaces. Dialog box A was designed for white American females while dialog box B was designed for European adult male intellectuals. The rationale behind Marcus's ideas was that European adult male intellectuals like "suave prose, a restrained treatment of information density, and a classical approach to font selection, e.g. the use of serif type in axial symmetric layouts similar to those found in elegant bronze European building identification signs." In contrast, white American females "prefer a more detailed presentation, curvilinear shapes and the absence of some of the more brutal terms ? favored by male software engineers."
Social Mechanisms in Communication a ,  | The kinds of information that are circulated in different social circles are diverse, varying among social groups and across cultures. The frequency with which it is disseminated is also highly variable. It can happen continuously throughout the day, once a day, weekly, or infrequently. The means by which communication happens are also flexible?it can take place via face-to-face conversations, telephone, videophone, instant messaging, texting, email, fax, and letters. Non-verbal communication also plays an important role in augmenting face-to-face conversation, involving the use of facial expressions, back channeling (?aha? and ?umm?), voice intonation, gesturing, and other kinds of body language.

Conversational Mechanisms ,  | Comment: Such conversational mechanisms enable people to coordinate their ?talk? with one another, allowing them to know how to start and stop. Throughout a conversation further ?turn-taking? rules are followed, enabling people to know when to listen, when it is their cue to speak, and when it is time for them to stop again to allow the others to speak. Sacks et al. (1978)? who are famous for their work on conversation analysis ?describe these in terms of three basic rules:

Conversational Mechanisms ,  | Comment: To facilitate rule following, people use various ways of indicating how long they are going to talk and on what topic. For example, a speaker might say right at the beginning of their turn in the conversation that he has three things to say. A speaker may also explicitly request a change in speaker by saying, "OK, that's all I want to say on that matter. So, what do you think?" to a listener. More subtle cues to let others know that their turn in the conversation is coming to an end include the lowering or raising of the voice to indicate the end of a question or the use of phrases like, "You know what I mean?" or simply, ?OK?? Back channeling (uhhuh, mmm), body orientation, e.g. moving away from or closer to someone, gaze (staring straight at someone or glancing away), and gesture, e.g. raising of arms, are also used in different combinations when talking, to signal to others when someone wants to hand over or take up a turn in the conversation.

Conversational Mechanisms ,  | Kinds of Conversations: Conversations can take a variety of forms, such as an argument, a discussion, a debate, a chat, a t?ete?-t?ete, or giving someone a ?telling off.? A well-known distinction in conversation types is between formal and informal communication. Formal communication involves assigning certain roles to people and prescribing a priori the types of turns that people are allowed to take in a conversation. For example, at a board meeting, it is decided who is allowed to speak, who speaks when, who manages the turn-taking, and what the participants are allowed to talk about.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | 4.2.2 Designing Collaborative Technologies to Support Conversation As we have seen, ?talk? and the way it is managed is integral to coordinating social activities. One of the challenges confronting designers is to consider how the different kinds of communication can be facilitated and supported in settings where there may be obstacles preventing it from happening ?naturally.? A central concern has been to develop systems that allow people to communicate with each other when they are in physically different locations and thus not able to communicate in the usual face-to-face manner. In particular, a key issue has been to determine how to allow people to carry on communicating as if they were in the same place, even though they are geographically separated ?sometimes many thousands of miles apart. Another challenge has been to design collaborative technologies to help colocated groups communicate and work together more effectively, especially when creating and sharing content.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | One of the earliest collaborative systems that was developed, based on a theory of conversational mechanisms, was the Coordinator system (Winograd and Flo-res, 1986). It was developed to help people work more effectively through improving the way they communicate with one another. An assumption was that communication could be improved if people could distinguish among the kinds of commitments they make in conversation that are normally implicit. The rationale behind the Coordinator system was to enable users to develop a better awareness of the value of using such ?speech acts.?
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | The Coordinator system was targeted at a variety of work settings, including sales, finance, general management, and planning. Emails could be sent between people in the form of explicit speech acts. For example, when sending someone a request, say "Could you get the report to me," the sender could also select the menu option ?request.? This would be placed in the subject header of the message, thereby explicitly specifying the nature of the speech act. Other speech-act options included offer, promise, inform, and question. The system also asked the user to fill in the dates by which the request should be completed. The user receiving such a message had the option of responding with another labeled speech act. These included:

Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: Figure 4.2: The Hydra system: Each ?hydra? unit consists of a camera, monitor, and speaker and is meant to act as a surrogate for a person in a different space. The design is intended to preserve the personal space that people have in face-to-face meetings, simulating where they would sit in the physical space if they were physically present (Sellen et al., 1992)
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Box 4.2: VideoWindow System (see Figure 4.3) . The goal was to design a shared space that would allow people in different locations to carry on a conversation as they would do if sitting in the same room drinking coffee together. Two lounge areas that were 50 miles apart were connected with high-bandwidth video channels and full-duplex four-channel audio. Connecting them was a 3 foot ? 8 foot ?picture-window? onto which video images were projected. The large size was meant to allow viewers to see a room of people roughly the same size as themselves. The system was designed to be active 24 hours a day, so that anyone entering one room could speak to whoever happened to be in the other room.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Box 4.2: A study by Kraut et al. (1990) of how effective the system was showed that, in general, many of the interactions that took place between the remote conversants were indeed indistinguishable from similar face-to-face interactions?with the exception that they spoke a bit louder and constantly talked about the video system. However, they also found that people who were in the same room tended to talk more with each other than with those in the video-linked room. Various usability problems were identified as contributing to this reluctance to talk with video images of other people. One of these was the tendency for people to move closer to the picture window to strike up a conversation with someone (which is what one would normally do in a face-to-face setting); this had the opposite effect to what the person intended, as it moved his or her head out of the picture and also out of microphone range, meaning he or she could not be seen or heard. Thus, rather than getting nearer to the other person, this behavior had the counterintuitive effect of removing him or her from the ?picture.? Moreover, there was no way for participants to know whether they were being seen and heard by the others in the other room. This inability to monitor how others are or are not ?receiving? you caused numerous problems. Another problem was that the system allowed only public conversations, meaning that they could be heard by everyone in the rooms. Such public broadcasting contrasts with how people normally engage in informal face-to-face conversations, where they will often whisper and conspire with each other when a topic becomes more private or secret. Such private conversations clearly could not be supported by the VideoWindow system.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Box 4.2: Another early system, Cruiser, was designed to support informal communication by placing separate audio and video equipment on the desktop of each person who was connected to the system (Fish, 1989) . This set-up differed from the Vide-oWindow system in that it enabled both public and private interactions to take place. It also provided additional functionality that allowed people to initiate conversations by typing in a cruise command followed by a question like, "I'm bored. Anyone want a chat?" or "Can someone help me?"? the aim here being explicitly to encourage people to engage in the kind of talk that they normally do when they bump into each other, but this time over the computer network. A further conversation mechanism built into Cruiser was a ?glance? feature that allowed users to check whether the person they wanted to talk to was in fact available before trying to initiate a conversation.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: On the other hand, it is interesting to look at how the new communication technologies have been extending the way people talk and socialize. SMS texting and instant messaging enable quite different ways of holding a conversation at a distance. Texting enables people to hold fragmentary conversations over long periods, commenting on what each is doing or thinking, allowing the other to keep posted on current developments. The conversation typically comprises short phrases that are typed in or selected from a menu of pre-stored phrases. These kinds of ?streamlined? conversations are coordinated simply by taking turns sending and receiving messages. Online chatting and instant messaging have also resulted in new genres of conversation that compensate for the constraints of the medium, where shorthand and abbreviations are frequently used, e.g. the use of expressions like ?LOL?? laugh out loud?in response to someone typing in something funny that has happened to them. They also allow hundreds and even
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: An alternative approach is to design a physical space where people can enter and exit a conversation with a stranger in more subtle ways, i.e. one where people do not feel threatened or embarrassed, and which does not require a high level of commitment. The Opinionizer system was designed along these lines, with the aim of encouraging people in an informal gathering to share their opinions visually and anonymously (Brignull and Rogers, 2003). The collective creation of opinions via a public display was intended to provide a talking point to others standing beside it, and to comment on to their neighbor. Users submit their opinions by typing them in at a public keyboard. To add ?color? and ?personality? to their opinions, a selection of small cartoon avatars and speech bubbles were available. The screen was also divided into four labeled quadrants representing different backgrounds, e.g. ?techie,? ?softie,? ?designer,? or ?student?, to provide a further talking point.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: When the Opinionizer was placed in various social gatherings, a ?honey-pot? effect was observed: as the number of people in the immediate vicinity of the Opinionizer increased, a sociable ?buzz? was created in the area. By standing in this space and showing an interest,

Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Asynchronous communication: Flaming can take place, where a user writes an angry email expressed in uninhibited language that is much stronger than normal when interacting with the same person face-toface. This includes the use of impolite statements, exclamation marks, capitalized sentences or words, swearing, and superlatives. Such ?charged? communication can lead to misunderstandings and bad feelings among the recipients.

Coordination Mechanisms ,  | When people are working closely together they talk to each other, issuing commands and letting others know how they are progressing with their part. For example, when two or more people are collaborating together, as in moving a piano, they shout to each other commands like "Down a bit, left a bit, now straight forward" to coordinate their actions with each other. As in a conversation, nods, shakes, winks, glances, and hand-raising are also used in combination with such coordination ?talk? to emphasize and sometimes replace it.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | The tendency of people not to follow conventions can be due to a number of reasons. If following conventions requires additional work that is extraneous to the users' ongoing work, they may find it gets in the way. They may also perceive the convention as an unnecessary burden and ?forget? to follow it all the time. Such ?productive laziness? is quite common. A simple analogy to everyday life is forgetting to put the top back on the toothpaste tube: it is a very simple convention to follow and yet we are all guilty sometimes (or even all the time) of not doing this. While such actions may only take a tiny bit of effort, people often don't do them because they perceive them as tedious and unnecessary. However, the consequence of not doing them can be very annoying to others and make the system much less efficient and workable.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | A more flexible form of coordination is to include a social policy of floor control. Whenever a user wants to work on a shared document or file, he must initially request ?the floor.? If no one else is using the specified section or file at that time, then he is given the floor. That part of the document or file then becomes locked, preventing others from having access to it. If other users want access to the file, they likewise make a request for the floor. The current user is then notified and can then let the requester know how long the file will be in use. If not acceptable, the requester can try to negotiate a time for access to the file. This kind of coordination mechanism, therefore, provides more scope for negotiation between users on how to collaborate, rather than simply receiving a point-blank ?permission denied? response from the system when a file is being used by someone else.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | At one site, a project coordinator would write up on a physical whiteboard every morning the main projects, schedules, and deadlines relevant for that day fed from the online project management software. When asked why she laboriously wrote down by hand information that could be readily accessed by everyone over the computer network, she replied that, owing to the multiplication of projects and people working on them, it had become very difficult to keep track of everything that was going on. Moreover, people had become desensitized to the many email reminders that the software application provided, so they often forgot their significance immediately after having acknowledged them. Consequently, everyone ( including herself) needed to be reminded of what was urgent and what needed dealing with that day. Placing this critical information on a physical whiteboard in a prominent public place that was clearly distinct from the continuous stream of other online information and messages provided a more effective public reminder of what was urgent and needed doing that day. In essence, the company had resorted to ?turning the technology inside out?.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Comment: Electronic whiteboards have the added advantage that important information can be animated to make it stand out. Important information can also be displayed on multiple displays throughout a building and can be fed from existing databases and software, thereby making the project coordinator's work much easier. The boards could also be used to support on-the-fly meetings in which individuals could use electronic pens to sketch out ideas that could then be stored electronically. In such settings they could also be interacted with via wireless handheld computers, allowing information to be ?scraped? off or ?squirted? onto the whiteboard.
Awareness Mechanisms ,  | Similar ways of becoming aware and keeping aware take place in other contexts, such as a place of study, at work, or school. Importantly, this requires fathoming when it is an appropriate time to interact with others to get and pass information on. Seeing a professor slam the office door signals to students that this is definitely not a good time to ask for an extension on an assignment deadline. Conversely, seeing teachers with beaming faces, chatting openly to other students suggests they are in a good mood and therefore this would be a good time to ask them if it would be all right to miss next week's seminar because of an important family engagement. The knowledge that someone is approachable or not rapidly spreads through a company, school, or other institution. People are very eager to pass on both good and bad news to others and will go out of their way to gossip, loitering in corridors, hanging around at the photocopier and coffee machine ?spreading the word.?
Awareness Mechanisms ,  | In addition to monitoring the behavior of others, people will organize their work and physical environment to enable it to be successfully monitored by others. This ranges from the use of subtle cues to more blatant ones. An example of a subtle cue is when someone leaves their dorm or office door slightly ajar to indicate that they can be approached. A more blatant one is the complete closing of their door together with a ?do not disturb? notice prominently on it, signaling to everyone that under no circumstances should they be disturbed (see Figure 4.12).
Awareness Mechanisms ,  | Overhearing and Overseeing: People who work closely together also develop various strategies for coordinating their work, based on an up-to-date awareness of what the others are doing. This is especially so for interdependent tasks, where the outcome of one person's activity is needed for others to be able to carry out their tasks. For example, when putting on a show, the performers will constantly monitor what one another is doing in order to coordinate their performance efficiently. The metaphorical expression ?closely-knit teams? exemplifies this way of collaborating. People become highly skilled in reading and tracking what others are doing and the information they are attending to. A well-known study of this phenomenon is described by Christian Heath and Paul Luff (1992), who looked at how two controllers worked together in a control room in the London Underground. An overriding observation was that the actions of one controller were tied very closely to what the other was doing. One of the controllers was responsible for the movement of trains on the line (controller A), while the other was responsible for providing information to passengers about the current service (controller B). In many instances, it was found that controller B overheard what controller A was doing and saying, and acted accordingly?even though controller A had not said anything explicitly to him. For example, on overhearing controller A discussing a problem with a train driver over the in-cab intercom system, controller B inferred from the ensuing conversation that there was going to be a disruption to the service and so started announcing this to the passengers on the platform before controller A had even finished talking with the train driver. At other times, the two controllers keep a lookout for each other, monitoring the environment for actions and events which they might have not noticed but may be important for them to know about so that they can act appropriately.
Designing Collaborative Technologi ,  | Hence, there has been a shift towards supporting a collective ?stream of consciousness? that people can attend to when they want and likewise provide information for whom they want. An example is Elvin, which is a distributed awareness system that provides a range of client services (Segall and Arnold, 1997) . It includes Tickertape, a lightweight messaging system, that shows small color-coded messages scrolling from right to left across a user's screen, together with virtual presence windows, indicating who is online or offline and for how long (see Figure 4.14) . This and other Internet instant messaging systems provide a number of functions, including a chat and local organizing tool for shared events, e.g. lunch dates, and announcements, e.g. a party, and an ?always-on? communication tool for people working together on projects but who are not physically collocated.
Mental Models ,  | It is assumed that mental models are used by people to reason about a system, and in particular, to try to fathom out what to do when something unexpected happens with the system or when encountering unfamiliar systems. The more someone learns about a system and how it functions, the more their mental model develops. For example, TV engineers have a ?deep? mental model of how TVs work that allows them to work out how to fix them. In contrast, an average citizen is likely to have a reasonably good mental model of how to operate a TV but a ?shallow? mental model of how it works. Within cognitive psychology, mental models have been postulated as internal constructions of some aspect of the external world that are manipulated, enabling predictions and inferences to be made (Craik, 1943). This process is thought to involve the ?fleshing out? and the ?running? of a mental model (Johnson-Laird, 1983). This can involve both unconscious and conscious mental processes, where images and analogies are activated.

It seems that in the above scenarios, they are running a mental model based on a general valve theory of the way something works (Kempton, 1986). This assumes the underlying principle of ?more is more:? the more you turn or push something the more it causes the desired effect. This principle holds for a range of physical devices, such as faucets and radio controls, where the more you turn them the more water or volume is given. However, it does not hold for thermostats, which instead function based on the principle of an on?off switch. What seems to happen is that in everyday life people develop a core set of abstractions about how things work, and apply these to a range of devices, irrespective of whether they are appropriate.

Just watch people at a pedestrian crossing or waiting for an elevator. How many times do they press the button? A lot of people will press it at least twice. When asked why a common reason given is that they think it will make the lights change faster or ensure the elevator arrives. This seems to be another example of following the ?more is more? philosophy: it is believed that the more times you press the button the more likely it is to result in the desired effect.

Functions that are difficult to learn can be off-putting. Users simply won't bother to make the extra effort, meaning that many of the functions provided are never used. Other users like to understand how the device they are using works in order to make informed decisions about how to carry out their tasks, especially if there are numerous ways of doing something. Some search engines have been designed with this in mind: they provide background information on how they work and how to improve one's searching techniques (see Figure 3.8).
Theory of Action ,  | Interpret the state.: Related to the theory of action is the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation (Norman, 1986; Hutchins et al., 1986). The ?gulfs? explicate the gaps that exist between the user and the interface and point to how to design the latter to enable the user to cope with them. The first one?the gulf of execution?describes the distance from the user to the physical system while the second one?the gulf of evaluation?is the distance from the physical system to the user (see Figure 3.9) . Norman and his colleagues suggest that designers and users need to concern themselves with how to bridge the gulfs in order to reduce the cognitive effort required to perform a task. This can be achieved, on the one hand, by designing usable interfaces that match the psychological characteristics of the user, e.g. taking into account their memory limitations, and, on the other hand, by the user learning to create goals, plans, and action sequences that fit with how the interface works.
Theory of Action ,  | Interpret the state.: New conceptual frameworks have also been spawned. Quintana et al. (2000) have used the gulfs as the basis of their learner-centered design (LCD) approach, that has been influential in informing the design of educational applications. They stress the need to bridge the ?gulf of expertise? between a learner and the domain they are learning about. Bellotti et al. (2002) have also used it as the basis of their ?making sense? framework that addresses the new challenges facing designers when developing ubiquitous computing systems.

Similarly, when we are at home we do not have to remember where everything is because information is ?out there.? We decide what to eat and drink by scanning the items in the fridge, find out whether any messages have been left by glancing at the answering machine to see if there is a flashing light, and so on. To what extent, therefore, can we say that information processing models are truly representative of everyday cognitive activities? Moreover, do they adequately account for how people interact with computers and other devices?
. Within these stages, various pro ,  | Instead, there has been an increasing trend to study cognitive activities in the context in which they occur, analyzing cognition as it happens "in the wild" (Hutchins, 1995). A central goal has been to look at how structures in the environment can both aid human cognition and reduce cognitive load. Two approaches that have adopted this approach are ?external? and ?distributed? cognition, which we now turn our attention to.
External Cognition , 1.	Carrying out the sum using pen and paper is easier than doing it in your head because you ?offload? some of the computation by writing down partial results and using them to continue with the calculation. Doing the same sum with a calculator is even easier, because it requires only eight simple key presses. Even more of the computation has been offloaded onto the tool. You need only follow a simple internalized procedure (key in first number, then the multiplier sign, then next number, and finally the equals sign) and then read off the result from the external display. | 1.

You need only follow a simple internalized procedure (key in first number, then the multiplier sign, then next number, and finally the equals sign) and then read off the result from the external display.
External Cognition , 2.	Using Roman numerals to do the same sum is much harder: 2 by 3 becomes II ? III, and 234 by 456 becomes CCXXXIIII ? CCC-CXXXXXVI. The first calculation may be possible to do in your head or on a bit of paper, but the second is incredibly difficult to do in your head or even on a piece of paper ( unless you are an expert in using Roman numerals or you ?cheat? and transform it into Arabic numerals). Calculators do not have Roman numerals so it would be impossible to do on a calculator. Hence, it is much harder to perform the calculations using Roman numerals than algebraic numerals?even though the problem is equivalent in both conditions. The reason for this is that the two kinds of representation transform the task into one that is easy and one that is more difficult, respectively. The kind of tool used also can change the nature of the task to being more or less easy. | 2.	Using Roman numerals to do the same sum is much harder: 2 by 3 becomes II ?

Distributed Cognition ,  | The distributed cognition approach studies the nature of cognitive phenomena across individuals, artifacts, and internal and external representations (Hutchins, 1995). Typically, it involves describing a ?cognitive system,? which entails interactions among people, the artifacts they use, and the environment they are working in (see Figure 3.14) . It differs from the external cognition approach in that it provides a more extensive account of the cognitive system.
Distributed Cognition ,  | This way of describing and analyzing a cognitive activity contrasts with other cognitive approaches, e.g. the information processing model, in that it focuses not on what is happening inside the head of an individual, but on what is happening across a system of individuals and artifacts. For example, in the cognitive system of the cockpit, a number of people and artifacts are involved in the activity of ?flying to a higher altitude.? The air traffic controller initially tells the co-pilot when it is safe to fly to a higher altitude. The co-pilot then alerts the pilot, who is flying the plane, by moving a knob on the instrument panel in front of them, indicating that it is now safe to fly (see Figure 3.15) . Hence, the information concerning this activity is transformed through different media (over the radio, through the co-pilot, and via a change in the position of an instrument).
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Many of us now spend a large proportion of our time staring at a computer screen. While focusing on one task at the screen we switch constantly between others, for example, every 5?10 minutes while writing this chapter I check my email, breaking off sometimes in midsentence to see who has sent me a message and then finding myself diverted to looking at the latest news item or website recommended to me by a colleague. Like nearly everyone else, I am addicted; I can't stop myself from looking.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | I have watched others engaged in ?multi-apping? to the point of awe. For example, while attending a talk at a conference I watched a student volunteer in front of me deftly switch between four ongoing instant message chats (one at the conference, one at school, one with friends, one at her part-time job), read, answer, delete, and place all new messages in various folders of her two email accounts, check and scan through a large list of blogs and news feeds?while appearing to listen to the talk, take some notes, google the speaker's background, and open up his publications. When she had a spare moment she played a game of patience. I must say, I felt quite exhausted just watching her for 10 minutes. It was as if she was capable of living in multiple worlds all at the same time while not letting a moment go to waste. But how much did she take in of the talk?
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Moreover, is it possible to pay attention to and not get distracted from the main ongoing activity in our work, e.g. writing an essay, listening to a lecture, when simultaneously engaged in numerous ?back channel?, screen-based activities? Surely there must be some detrimental effects? As noted by Katie Hafner (2005), a technology reporter, "distracting oneself used to consist of sharpening a half-dozen pencils or lighting a cigarette. Today, there is a universe of diversions to buy, hear, watch and forward, which makes focussing on a task all the more challenging."
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: People often write down what they need to remember on a piece of paper. They also ask others to remind them. Another approach is to use various mental strategies, like mnemonics. A mnemonic involves taking the first letters of a set of words in a phrase or set of concepts and using them to make a more memorable phrase, often using bizarre and idiosyncratic connections. For example, some people have problems working out where east is in relation to west and vice versa, i.e. is it to the left or right. A mnemonic to help figure this out is to take the first letters of the four main points of the compass and then use them in the phrase ?Never Eat Shredded Wheat,? mentally recited in a clockwise sequence.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: Mark Lansdale and Ernest Edmonds (1992) suggest that it is profitable to view this kind of remembering as involving two memory processes: recall-directed, followed by recognitionbased scanning. The first refers to using memorized information about the required file to get as close to it as possible. The more exact this is the more success the user will have in tracking down the desired file. The second happens when recall has failed to produce what a user wants and so requires reading through a list. To illustrate the difference between these two processes, consider the following scenario: a user is trying to access a couple of websites she visited the week before that compared the selling price of cars offered by different dealers. The user is able to recall the name of one website, ?autobargains.com.? She types this in and the website appears. This is an example of successful recall-directed memory. However, the user is unable to remember the name of the second one. She vaguely remembers it was something like
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: ?alwaysthecheapest.com,? but typing this in proves unsuccessful. Instead, she switches to scanning her history list and selects the folder labeled more than six days ago. She notices two or three URLs that could be the one desired at the top of the list, and on the second attempt she finds the website she is looking for. In this situation, the user initially tries recalldirected memory and when this fails, adopts the second strategy of recognition-based scanning?which takes longer but eventually results in success.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: Powerful search engines have gone a long way towards helping people track down the files they want. For example, various search and find tools, such as Apple's Spotlight, enable the user to type a full or partial name or even the first letter of a file that it then searches for in the entire system, including emails, contacts, images, calendars, and applications. Figure 3.5 shows part of a list of 158 files that Spotlight matched to the user's phrase ?cartoon?, prioritized in terms of what the user may be looking for, such as chapters and images.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Comment: Many of these are relatively easy to remember and recall as they are very familiar. But consider the last two. How easy is it for someone to come up with such memorable information and then be able to recall it readily? Perhaps the customer can give the address and birthday of another member of their family as a memorable address and date. But what about the request for a password? Suppose a customer selects the word ?interaction? as a password?fairly easy to remember. The problem is that the bank operators do not ask for the full password, because of the danger that someone in the vicinity might overhear and write it down. Instead they are instructed to ask the customer to provide specific letters from it, like the seventh followed by the fifth. However, such information does not spring readily to mind. Instead, it requires mentally counting each letter of the password until the desired one is reached. How long does it take you to determine the seventh letter of the password ?interaction?? How did you do it?
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Design Implications: Memory: Learning can be considered in terms of (i) how to use a computer-based application or (ii) using a computer-based application to understand a given topic. Jack Carroll (1990) and his colleagues have written extensively about how to design interfaces to help learners develop computer-based skills. A main observation is that people find it very hard to learn by following a set of instructions in a manual. Instead, they much prefer to ?learn through doing.? GUIs and direct manipulation interfaces are good environments for supporting this kind of active learning by supporting exploratory interaction and, importantly, allowing users to ?undo? their actions, i.e. return to a previous state if they make a mistake by clicking on the wrong option. Carroll has also suggested that another way of helping learners is by using a ?training-wheels? approach. This involves restricting the possible functions that can be carried out by a novice to the basics and then extending these as the novice becomes more experienced. The underlying rationale is to make initial learning more tractable, helping the learner focus on simple operations before moving on to more complex ones.
seconds to search the top screen and ,  | Design Implications: Memory: One form of interactivity that has been found to be highly effective is ?dynalinking? (Rogers and Scaife, 1998) . Abstract representations, such as diagrams, are linked together with a more concrete illustration of what they stand for, such as simulation. Changes in one are matched by changes in the other, enabling a better understanding of what the abstraction means. An example where it has been used is in the design of Pondworld, aimed at helping students learn ecological concepts, e.g. food webs. A concrete simulation showed various organisms swimming and moving around and occasionally an event where one would eat another, e.g. a snail eating the weed. This was annotated and accompanied by various eating sounds,

Anthropomorphism in Interaction Desi ,  | It is well known that people readily attribute human qualities to their pets and their cars, and, conversely, are willing to accept human attributes that have been assigned by others to cartoon characters, robots, and toys. Advertisers are well aware of this phenomenon and often create human-like characters out of inanimate objects to promote their products. For example, breakfast cereals, butter, and fruit drinks have all been transmogrified into characters with human qualities (they move, talk, have personalities, and show emotions), enticing the viewer to buy them. Children are especially susceptible to this kind of ?magic,? as witnessed by their love of cartoons, where all manner of inanimate objects are brought to life with human-like qualities.
Anthropomorphism in Interaction Desi ,  | Anthropomorphism can also lead people into a false sense of belief, enticing them to confide in agents called ?software bots? that reside in chatrooms and other electronic spaces, pretending to be conversant human beings. Furthermore, children are no longer required to use their imagination when acting out real-life scenarios, e.g. playing doctors and nurses, but can play with dolls that control the play, telling them their wants and dislikes. By far the most common complaint against computers pretending to have human qualities, however, is that people find them very annoying. Once users discover that a system cannot really converse like a human or does not possess real human qualities (like having a personality or being sincere), they become quickly disillusioned and subsequently distrust it. E-commerce sites that pretend to be caring by presenting an assortment of virtual assistants, receptionists, and other such helpers are seen for what they really are?artificial. Children and adults alike also are quickly bored and annoyed with applications that are fronted by artificial screen characters, e.g. tutor wizards, and simply ignore whatever they might suggest.

Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: In the 1980s, the prevailing paradigm in human?computer interaction was how to design user-centered applications for the desktop computer. Questions about what and how to design were framed in terms of specifying the requirements for a single ?user? interacting with a screen-based ?interface.? Task analytic and usability methods were developed based on an individual user's cognitive capabilities. The acronym WIMP was used as one way of characterizing the core features of an interface for a single user: this stood for Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointer. This was later superseded by the GUI (graphical user interface), a term that has stuck with us ever since.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: Within interaction design, many changes took place in the mid- to late 1990s. The WIMP interface with its single thread, discrete event dialog was considered to be unnecessarily limiting, e.g. Jacob, 1996. Instead, many argued that new frameworks, tools, and applications were needed to enable more flexible forms of interaction to take place, having a higher degree of interactivity and parallel input/output exchanges. At the same time, other kinds of non-WIMP interfaces were experimented with. The shift in thinking, together with technological advances, led to a new generation of user? computer environments, including virtual reality, multimedia, agent interfaces, pen-based interfaces, eye-movement-based interfaces, tangible interfaces, collaborative interfaces, and ubiquitous computing. The effect of moving interaction design ?beyond the desktop? resulted in many new challenges, questions, and phenomena being considered. New methods of designing, modeling, and analyzing came to the fore. At the same time, new theories, concepts, and ideas entered the stage. A turn to the ?social,? the ?emotional,? and the ?environmental? began shaping what was studied, how it was studied, and ultimately what was designed. Significantly, one of the main frames of reference?the single user?was replaced by a set of others, including people, places, and context.
Paradigms ,  | The phenomena to be observed.: One of the most influential developments that took place was the birth of ubiquitous computing (Weiser, 1991) . A main idea was that the advent of ubiquitous computing (or ?UbiComp? as it is commonly known ) would radically change the way people think about and interact with computers. In particular, computers would be designed to be part of the environment, embedded in a variety of everyday objects, devices, and displays (see Figure 6.1) . The idea behind Weiser's vision was that a ubiquitous computing device would enter a person's center of attention when needed and move to the periphery of their attention when not, enabling the person to switch calmly and effortlessly between activities without having to figure out how to use a computer in performing their tasks. In essence, the technology would be unobtrusive and largely disappear into the background. People would be able to get on with their everyday and working lives, interacting with information and communicating and collaborating with others without being distracted or becoming frustrated with technology.
Setting Goals ,  | The main reason for gathering data at all is to glean information about something. For example, you might want to understand how technology fits into normal family life, or you might want to identify which of two icons representing a ?send email? action is easier to use, or you might want to find out whether the redesign you are planning for a hand-held meter reader is along the right lines. There are many different reasons for gathering data, and before beginning it is important to identify specific goals for the particular study. The goals that are set will influence the nature of the data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and also the analysis to be performed. Once the goals have been set, then you can concentrate on what data to look for and what to do with it once it is gathered.
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | It is important not to pre-empt an answer by phrasing a question to suggest that a particular answer is expected. For example, "You seemed to like this use of color?" assumes that this is the case and will probably encourage the interviewee to answer that this is true so as not to offend the interviewer. Children are particularly prone to behave in this way (see Box 7.2 for more on data gathering with children). The body language of the interviewer, for example, whether she is smiling, scowling, looking disapproving, etc., can have a strong influence on whether the interviewee will agree with a question.
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | Children think and react to situations differently from adults. Sitting a 4-year-old child down in a formal interview situation is unlikely to result in anything other than a wall of silence. If children are to be included in your data gathering sessions, then child-friendly methods are needed to make them feel at ease. For example, for very young children of pre-reading or early reading age, data gathering sessions need to rely on images and chat rather than written instructions or questionnaires. Read et al. (2002) have developed a set of ?smileys? for use with children in interviews (see Figure 7.1).
Semi-Structured Interviews ,  | The appropriate techniques to involve children also depend on the goal of the data gathering session. For example, Guha et al. (2005) work with children as technology design partners. They focus on children between the ages of 7 and 11. They have found that unexpected innovations result when working as an inter-generational team, i.e. adults and children working together. The method they use is called cooperative inquiry (Druin, 2002) and is based on Scandinavian cooperative design practices, participatory design, and contextual inquiry. There are many techniques that can be used in cooperative inquiry, such as sketching ideas and brainstorming, and observational research which has been modified to accommodate children's preferred approaches. For example, the ?mixing ideas? approach (which also works with younger children, aged 5 to 6) involves three stages. In the first stage, each child generates ideas, working one-on-one with an adult. In the second stage, groups of adults and children mix together these ideas. Finally, all the ideas are mixed together to form ?the big idea? (see Figure 7.2). Guha et al.
Focus Groups ,  | So, can interviewers believe all the responses they get? Are the respondents giving ?the truth? or are they simply giving the answers that they think the interviewer wants to hear?
Planning and Conducting an Intervi ,  | Questions for an interview may be open or closed. Open questions are best suited to interviews where the goal of the session is exploratory. Closed questions require a list of possible answers, and so they can only be used in a situation where you know the possible answers in advance. It is always possible to have an ?other? option, but the ideal is that this option is not used very often. So whether you choose to use open questions or closed questions depends on what is already known about the topic of investigation and the goal of the interview. An unstructured interview will usually consist entirely of open questions, while a structured interview will usually consist of closed questions. A semi-structured interview may use a combination of both types.

Planning and Conducting an Intervi , 3.	Why?last:. Some closed questions that you might ask include: | This is fun/cool: I don't like her ?personality?
Questionnaires ,  | It can be harder to develop good questionnaire questions compared with structured interview questions because the interviewer is not available to explain them or to clarify any ambiguities. Because of this, it is important that questions are specific; when possible, closed questions should be asked and a range of answers offered, including a ?no opinion? or ?none of these? option. Finally, negative questions can be confusing and may lead to the respondents giving false information. Some questionnaire designers use a mixture of negative and positive questions deliberately because it helps to check the users' intentions. In contrast, the designers of QUIS (Box 7.3) (Chin et al., 1988) decided not to mix negative and positive statements because the questionnaire was already complex enough without forcing participants to pay attention to the direction of the argument.
Designing the Questionnaire's Stru ,  | typography.: Box 7.4 contains an excerpt from a paper questionnaire designed to evaluate users' satisfaction with some specific features of a prototype website for career changers aged 34?59 years.
Question and Response Format ,  | Check Boxes and Ranges: The range of answers to demographic questionnaires is predictable. Gender, for example, has two options, male or female, so providing the two options and asking respondents to circle a response makes sense for collecting this information (as in Box 7.4) . A similar approach can be adopted if details of age are needed. But since some people do not like to give their exact age, many questionnaires ask respondents to specify their age as a range (see Box 7.4) . A common design error arises when the ranges overlap. For example, specifying two ranges as 15?20, 20?25 will cause confusion: which box do people who are 20 years old check? Making the ranges 14?19, 20?24 avoids this problem.
Question and Response Format ,  | Check Boxes and Ranges: A frequently asked question about ranges is whether the interval must be equal in all cases. The answer is that it depends on what you want to know. For example, if you want to collect information for the design of an e-commerce site to sell life insurance, the target population is going to be mostly people with jobs in the age range of, say, 21?65 years. You could, therefore, have just three ranges: under 21, 21?65, and over 65. In contrast, if you wanted to see how the population's political views varied across the generations, you might be interested in looking at 10-year cohort groups for people over 21, in which case the following ranges would be appropriate: under 21, 22?31, 32?41, etc.

Question and Response Format , 3.	Select items for the final questionnaire and reword as necessary to make them clear. | Many questionnaires use seven- or five-point scales and there are also three-point scales. Arguments for the number of points go both ways. Advocates of long scales argue that they help to show discrimination, as advocated by the QUIS team (QUIS has a nine-point scale; Box 7.3 (Chin et al., 1988)). Rating features on an interface is more difficult for most people than, say, selecting among different flavors of ice cream, and when the task is difficult there is evidence to show that people ?hedge their bets.? Rather than selecting the poles of the scales if there is no right or wrong, respondents tend to select values nearer the center. The counter-argument is that people cannot be expected to discern accurately among points on a large scale, so any scale of more than five points is unnecessarily difficult to use.

This may be achieved in four stages: the survey is reviewed by knowledgeable analysts; typical participants complete the survey using a think-aloud protocol (see below); a small version of the study is attempted; a final check to catch small errors is conducted. | Comment: more often from a drop-down menu than from a list of options that are chosen via radio buttons. Alternatively, you may find no difference and that people's opinions are not affected by the widget style used at the interface. Any differences found, of course, may be due to the variation between individual responses rather than being caused by features in the questionnaire design. To tease the effects apart you would need to ask a large number of participants, e.g. in the order of 50?100, to respond to the questions for each design.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The study goals provide an orienting focus for the formulation of themes. For example, consider a survey to evaluate whether the information displayed on a train travel website is adequate and sufficient. Several of the respondents add comments to the survey suggesting that, as well as the origin and destination stations, the station stops in between should also be displayed. This is a theme relevant to the study goals and would be reported as a main theme. In another part of the survey, under ?further comments? you might notice that several respondents comment that the company's logo is distracting. Although this too is a theme in the data, it is not directly relevant to the study's goals and may be reported only as a minor theme.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | The researchers used an approach which allowed them to track important cultural values?in each country they started by visiting a small town, then moved to a city, and then to a larger metropolitan area. In this way, they could initially understand the daily rhythm of life in the country in a manageable context before moving to the more complex situations. They assumed that any patterns which were observed in all three different contexts were likely to be significant. Taking an ethnographic stance, the researchers tried to do everything that native people would normally do. They followed people around and asked lots of questions about what life was like and what people do. Four significant themes (called ?domains? by the researchers) were identified from this work: togetherness, media experiences, consumption habits, and life outside of the home.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Togetherness. Family, kinship, and community were found to be very significant in Europe. For example, the importance of the family eating together was a recurrent theme in the interviews and in the team's observations. Other occasions also promote social gatherings, such as sporting events and leisure activities. The researchers noted that sometimes people spend time together simply watching television. They found an emphasis on face-to-face social time throughout their studies, and the willingness of people to expend effort to maintain this ?togetherness.?
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Media experiences. The researchers found that many different kinds of media play a variety of roles in European life? both consumption and production of content. For example, they found people painting, playing musical instruments, sketching and drawing in nearly every population center they visited.
Identifying Recurring Patterns or  ,  | Life outside of the home. The researchers were struck by the variety of spaces outside the home where people socialized, and by the diversity of behaviors they observed. For example, people talk, flirt, play games, admire, create art, listen to music, eat, dance, swim, walk, and ?hang out? in gardens, parks, bars, pubs, cafes, promenades, markets, boulevards, and plazas. How often people frequent these places, and what they do there, changes with age and life stage.

Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | Data gathering sessions for interaction design usually result in a lot of data. Analyzing all of that data in any detail would be very time-consuming, and is often not necessary. We have already suggested that themes, patterns and categories can be used to identify areas where detailed analysis is appropriate. Another approach is to use the ?critical incident technique.?
Looking for Critical Incidents ,  | The critical incident technique is a flexible set of principles that emerged from work carried out in the United States Army Air Forces where the goal was to identify the critical requirements of ?good? and ?bad? performance by pilots (Flanagan, 1954). It has two basic principles: "(a) reporting facts regarding behaviour is preferable to the collection of interpretations, ratings and opinions based on general impressions; (b) reporting should be limited to those behaviours which, according to competent observers, make a significant contribution to the activity" (Flanagan, 1954, p. 355). In the interaction design context, the use of well-planned observation sessions as discussed in Chapter 7 satisfies the first principle. The second principle is referring to critical incidents, i.e. incidents which are significant or pivotal to the activity being observed, in either a desirable or an undesirable way.

How you decide which is an interesting event will depend on what is being observed. For example, if you are studying the interruptions that occur in an open plan office, you would include each time a person breaks off from an ongoing activity, e.g. phone rings, someone walks into their cubicle, email arrives. If it is a study of how pairs of students use a collaborative learning tool then activities such as turn-taking, sharing of input device/s, speaking over one another, and ?fighting? over shared objects would be appropriate to record.
Grounded Theory ,  | The aim of grounded theory is to develop a theory that fits a set of collected data. By ?theory? is meant in this context: "a set of well-developed concepts related through statements of relationship, which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used to explain or predict phenomena" (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). Development of a ?grounded? theory progresses through alternating data collection and data analysis: first data is collected and analyzed to identify categories, then that analysis leads to the need for further data collection, which is analyzed, and more data is then collected. Data gathering is hence driven by the emerging theory. This approach continues until no new insights emerge and the theory is well-developed. During this process, the researcher needs to maintain a balance between objectivity and sensitivity. Objectivity is needed to maintain accurate and impartial interpretation of events; sensitivity is required to notice the subtleties in the data and identify relationships between concepts.
Grounded Theory ,  | The thrust of the analysis undertaken is to identify and define the properties and dimensions of relevant categories and then to use these as the basis for constructing a theory. Category identification and definition is achieved by ?coding? the data, i.e. marking it up according to the emerging categories. According to Strauss and Corbin (1998), this coding has three aspects, which are iteratively performed through the cycle of data collection and analysis:

One of these approaches (Couch, 1996) emphasizes the concepts that a theory of human conduct must use. The other focuses on social structure (Giddens, 1984). Using these two approaches, the category ?stages of team development? was chosen as the core category for the grounded theory to be built from this data set, and other categories were linked around it. This theory was further elaborated upon through discussions and reading of theory, and evolved into a theory of how virtual teams develop over time. More details can be found in Sarker and Sahay (2003).

They studied the introduction and use of digital libraries in four settings over a fouryear period, collecting data from a total of 144 users. Focus groups and interviews were the primary data collection techniques. They concluded that where technology is integrated with the communities and their practice, through an information intermediary, perceptions of empowerment were increased; where technology is deployed within communities, yet with poor design and support, technologies were perceived as complex and threatening; and where technology was designed in isolation from the communities, users were either unaware of the technology or perceived it as complex or threatening.

(2004) used semi-structured interviews and grounded theory to examine how people answer the question "Is this system secure enough for what I want to do now?," in the context of ubiquitous and mobile technologies. This qualitative approach was used to explore the issues before moving on to develop more detailed questions, but their conclusions included suggested design modifications to take this perspective on security into account.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Ed Hutchins emphasizes that an important part of doing a distributed cognition analysis is to have a deep understanding of the work domain that is being studied. He even recommends, where possible, that the investigators take steps to learn ?the trade? under study and become an accomplished pilot or sailor (as he has done himself in both cases). This can take a team of researchers several months and even years to accomplish and in most cases this is impractical for a research or design team to do.
Distributed Cognition ,  | It is at this point that knowledge of the theory of distributed cognition can help in interpreting and representing the observations of a work setting (see Chapter 3 and Hutchins, 1995). It provides an analytic framework and a set of concepts to describe what is happening at a higher level of abstraction. Problems can be described in terms of the communication pathways that are being hindered or the breakdowns arising due to information not propagating effectively from one representational state to another (see Box 8.7) . The framework can reveal where information is being ?distorted,? resulting in poor communication or inefficiency. Conversely, it can show when different technologies and the representations displayed via them are effective at mediating certain work activities and how well they are coordinated.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The cognitive system? the interactions among people, the artifacts they use, and the environment they are working in.
Distributed Cognition ,  | The communicative pathways? the channels by which information is passed between people, e.g. phone, email, physical gesture.
Distributed Cognition ,  | Propagation of representational states? how information is transformed across different media. Media refers to external artifacts (e.g. instruments, maps, paper notes) and internal representations (e.g. human memory). These can be socially mediated (e.g. passing on a message verbally), technologically mediated ( e.g. pressing a key on a computer), or mentally mediated (e.g. reading the time on a clock ).
Distributed Cognition ,  | One of the first things they noted is that call center operators are under a lot of pressure. They need to begin forming their answers within 45?60 seconds of answering a call. This can be very demanding, given the diversity of questions that can be asked and the round-about way of talking some callers adopt. However, they also observed that many of the queries the operators encounter are similar, enabling the operators to classify them into types and develop ?routines? for finding the information needed for a given type. At a finer level of analysis, Ackermann and Halverson decided to focus on the routines. They observed over 300 calls, taped 60 of them, and chose to analyze 10 in detail. The 10 were transcribed, covering the actions taken and the conversations that took place. One example of ?Joan? is used in their write up of the study to illustrate what is involved in a typical routine.
Distributed Cognition ,  | To begin, they drew a schematic bird's eye view of Joan's workplace, illustrating the physical set-up (see Figure 8.16) . The figure shows how the different workspaces are related to each other and the various resources that are used during calls. What stands out immediately from the figure is the way the resources are spread out, requiring Joan to walk from her desk to a shared table for every call. While keeping her fit, it also reveals that certain types of information have to be ?carried? between the different locations.
Activity Theory ,  | Activity theory (AT) is a product of Soviet psychology that explains human behavior in terms of our practical activity with the world. It originated as part of the attempt to produce a Marxist psychology, an enterprise usually associated with Vygotsky (e.g. 1926/1962) and later Leontiev (e.g. 1978, 1989). In the last 20?30 years, versions of AT have become popular elsewhere, particularly in Scandinavia, Germany, and now growing in the USA and UK. The newer ?versions? of AT have been popular in research investigating ?applied? problems, particularly those to do with work, technology, and education.
Activity Theory ,  | Activity theory provides a framework that focuses analysis around the concept of an ?activity? and helps to identify tensions between the different elements of the system. For example, Wendy Mackay et al. (2000) analyzed a 4-minute excerpt from a video of users working with a new software tool. They identified 19 shifts in attention between different parts of the tool interface and the task at hand. In fact, some users spent so much time engaged in these shifts that they lost track of their original task. Using the theory helped evaluators to focus on relevant incidents.
Activity Theory ,  | AT outlines two key models: one which outlines what constitutes an ?activity? and one which models the mediating role of artifacts.
Activity Theory ,  | The Individual Model: AT models activities in a hierarchical way. At the bottom level are ?operations,? routinized behaviors that require little conscious attention, e.g. rapid typing. At an intermediate level are ?actions,? behavior that is characterized by conscious planning, e.g. producing a glossary. The top level is the activity, and that provides a minimum meaningful context for understanding the individual actions, e.g. writing an essay (see Figure 8.18) . There may be many different operations capable of fulfilling an action, and many actions capable of serving the same activity.
Activity Theory ,  | The Individual Model: Activities can be identified on the basis of the motives that elicit them, actions on the basis of conscious goals that guide them, and operations by the conditions necessary to attain the goals. However, there is an intimate and fluid link between levels. Actions can become operations as they become more automatic and operations can become actions when an operation encounters an obstacle, thus requiring conscious planning. Similarly there is no strict demarcation between action and activity. If ?motive? changes then an activity can become an action. It is also important to realize that activities are not self-contained. Activities relate to others while actions may be part of different activities, and so on.
Activity Theory ,  | The Role of Artifacts: Artifacts can be physical, such as a book or a stone, or they can be abstract, such as a system of symbols or a set of rules. Physical artifacts have physical properties that cause humans to respond to them as direct objects to be acted upon. They also embody a set of social practices, their design reflecting a history of particular use. Leontiev describes the process of learning what these inherent properties are as one of ?appropriation,? signifying the active nature of the learning that is needed. The kind of learning involved is one of identifying and participating in the activity appropriate to the artifact. Consider an infant learning to feed with a spoon. Leontiev (1981) observed that, at first, the infant carries the spoon to its mouth as though it were handling any other object, not considering the need to hold it horizontal. Over time, with adult guidance, the spoon is shaped in the way it is because of the social practice?the activity?of feeding and, in turn, the infant's task is to learn that relationship?to discover what practice(s) the object embodies. By contrast a spoon dropped into the cage of a mouse, say, will only ever have the status of just another physical object?no different from that of a stone.
Activity Theory ,  | The Role of Artifacts: The idea of abstract artifacts follows from the idea of ?mediation,? i.e. a fundamental characteristic of human development is the change from a direct mode of acting on the world to one that is mediated by something else. In AT, the artifacts involved in an activity mediate between the elements of it.
Activity Theory , 1996) , have widened the focus from the ?individual? triangle of a single activity (subject, activity, and object) to include supra-individual concepts?tools, rules, community, and division of labor. By tool is meant the artifacts, signs, and means that mediate the subject and object; by community is meant those who share the same object; by rules is meant a set of agreed conventions and policies covering what it means to be a member of that community (set by laws, parents, managers, boards, etc.); and by division of labor is meant the primary means of classifying the labor in a workplace, e.g. manager, engineer, receptionist.

The conceptual model (Figure 8.18)  is the main framework that is used to describe levels within an activity. This means that identifying elements will be highly dependent on individual interpretation. Christiansen (1996, p. 177) summarizes: "Methodologically? the ideal data for an application of AT consist of longitudinal ethnographic observation, interviews and discussion in real-life settings, supplemented by experiments." She continues that you "cannot interview people directly through rote questions but must interpret their actions and opinions after some careful reflection," which is a difficult process. Nevertheless, the original and later versions of the AT framework have become popular amongst researchers and some practitioners as a way of identifying needs for new tools and to analyze problems that are present in a work or other setting.

The interviews were transcribed and documented with notes and artifacts produced by the interviewees during the conversation. These were then annotated in terms of particular elements of the activity system, e.g. rules, object.

What is Involved in Interaction Desi ,  | The previous chapters have introduced you to many exciting ideas, approaches, theories, and opinions about interaction design, but what does it mean to actually ?do? interaction design? The following activity is intended to start you thinking about this by asking you to produce an initial design for an interactive product.
What is Involved in Interaction Desi , 3.	The first thing that came into my head when I started doing this was the myriad of resources I currently use to plan my travel. For example, travel agents will arrange accommodation, visas, guided tours, etc., for me; I can look at paper-based or electronic timetables for journey routes and times, ring up automated timetable readers, operators who will give me travel advice, embassies who will also give me travel advice about their own country, websites to identify cheap flights, and so on. There is a long list. I then thought it would be good to combine the advantages of all of these into one system that could then be tailored to me. For example, so that the first airline offered for any flights is my favorite airline, and the starting point for my journeys is defaulted to my normal train station or airport. The next thing I focused on was the dialog I would have with the system. Hence, my sketches focus on questions the system might ask me and my responses. One of the things that occurred to me as I was producing this sketch is that the location I need to enter will depend on the kind of transport I choose, and the kind of help I need will also depend on the kind of transport I want to use. On the other hand, I would want the system to know that I am unlikely to want to drive in my car to Hong Kong, which is several thousand miles away, so it should automatically default to travel by air for some destinations, and similarly if there is no airport near a destination then it should know that I would not want to fly. | The ?look and feel? seemed very bland, and I then realized that I had been subconsciously focusing on business travel, which usually is about getting to and from a given location in the most convenient and comfortable manner; I am unlikely to be concerned about the location itself as I don't have a choice of destination. However, if I was planning travel for a holiday I am more likely to want pictures of the destination and descriptions of local activities, restaurants, historic sites, and so on. I might also want to enter my choices in a different way, focusing on the kind of holiday or location I want to travel to, and leaving the system to suggest alternatives. This led me to reconsider (although not redraw) my ideas.

Interaction design also involves these activities, and in addition we focus attention very clearly on users and their goals. For example, we investigate the artifact's use and target domain by taking a user-centered approach to development, we seek users' opinions and reactions to early designs, and we involve users appropriately in the development process itself. This means that users' concerns direct the development rather than just technical concerns, and for interaction design, the three fundamental activities of design listed above are extended to include an activity of producing a version of the design that users can interact with.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | The description above emphasizes the need to involve users in interaction design, but why is it important? In the past, developers would often talk to managers or to ?proxy users,? i.e. people who roleplayed as users, when eliciting requirements. While a proxy user can provide useful information, they will not have the same perspective as someone who performs the task every day, or who will use the intended product on a regular basis. For example, several years ago, I was involved with a system to process and record financial transactions from the foreign exchange (?forex?) dealers in a large international bank. The users of this system took the handwritten transaction records completed by the ?forex? dealers and entered the details into the system. The system then validated the transaction and communicated a confirmation to the relevant parties. When the requirements for this system were developed, no-one from the development team spoke to the end-users of the system; the requirements were identified by higher-level managers. Although the system was successfully used to support the task, the end-users had developed several ?work-arounds.? For example, the system required both buyer code and buyer name to be entered, but it was quite common for the dealers to write only the buyer name on their transaction chitty. It would have been simple to design the system to support entry of transactions based on names or codes, but this wasn't done?both fields were required. This wasted a lot of time as the users had to identify the codes manually.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | Expectation management is the process of making sure that the users' views and expectations of the new product are realistic. The purpose of expectation management is to ensure that there are no surprises for users when the product arrives. If users feel they have been ?cheated? by promises that have not been fulfilled, then this will cause resistance and maybe rejection. Expectation management is relevant whether you are dealing with an organization introducing a new software system or a company developing a new interactive toy. In both cases, the marketing of the new arrival must be careful not to misrepresent the product. How many times have you seen an advert for something you thought would be really good to have, but when you see one, discover that the marketing ?hype? was a little exaggerated? I expect you felt quite disappointed and let down. Well, this is the kind of feeling that expectation management tries to avoid.
The Importance of Involving Users ,  | A second reason for user involvement is ownership. Users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product's development are more likely to feel a sense of ?ownership? towards it and be receptive to it when it finally emerges.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Microsoft bases feature selection and prioritization on a technique called ?activity-based planning.? This technique involves studying what users do to achieve a certain activity like writing a letter, and using the results of the study to choose product features. Each new release of a software product is limited to supporting about four new major activities. Each of these proposed new activities can be broken down into sub-activities, and these mapped against features already existing in the software. Any new features required are noted. If a feature can support more than one activity, then it is placed higher in the priority list. The techniques used to gather customer data for activity-based planning do not appear to be prescribed in any way, and can vary from visiting customers through to asking them to use an instrumented version of the software, i.e. a version that records the actions they take. Microsoft also employs contextual inquiry (see chapter 10)  to learn about their customers' work, although they find that it can be time-consuming and the results ambiguous.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | Because the world of applications software changes so rapidly, developers need to continually observe and test with users. Throughout the development phase, usability tests are carried out in Microsoft's usability lab. Each time a developer believes that a feature is finished, then it is scheduled for testing in the usability lab. A group of about 10 users ?off the street? are invited into the lab to perform certain tasks, while their behavior is observed and their performance recorded. The data is then analyzed and the findings fed back into development. This results in thorough testing of all features. As an example, an early version of Office 4.0 went through over 8000 hours of usability testing.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): Development was divided into a number of areas, each with its own project team and its own schedule. Consistency across the areas was maintained through the development of a GUI interface standard style guide that ensured all systems had the same look and feel (style guides are discussed in Chapter 6). Users were involved in development on a number of different levels, typically 30?80% of their time. For example, in one area (Area E), one user was appointed full-time to manage the project team, two others joined the project team part-time for a limited period (about 18 months each), one user was consulted on a regular basis, and a wider set of users were involved through workshops and prototyping sessions. The project team also included technically trained analysts and developers.
Degrees of User Involvement ,  | ( Cusumano and Selby,  1995): On the other hand, Heinbokel et al. (1996) suggest that a high user involvement has some negative effects. They found that projects with high user participation showed lower overall success, fewer innovations, a lower degree of flexibility, and low team effectiveness, although these effects were noticeable only later in the project (at least 6?12 months into the project). In short, projects with a high level of user participation tended to run less smoothly. They identified four issues related to communication among users and developers that they suggest caused problems. First, as the project progressed, users developed more sophisticated ideas, and they wanted them to be incorporated late in the project. Second, users were fearful of job losses or worsening job conditions and this led to a tendency for participation to be not constructive. Third, users were unpredictable and not always sympathetic to software development matters. For example, they asked for significant changes to be made just as testing was due to start. Fourth, user orientation in the designers may lead to higher aspirations and hence higher levels of stress.
What is a User-Centered Approach? , 3.	Iterative design. When problems are found in user testing, they are fixed and then more tests and observations are carried out to see the effects of the fixes. This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of ?design, test, measure, and redesign? being repeated as often as necessary. | 3.	Iterative design.

This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of ?design, test, measure, and redesign? being repeated as often as necessary. | These three principles are now accepted as the basis for a user-centered approach (e.g. see Mao et al., 2005) , but when Gould and Lewis wrote their paper, they were not accepted by most developers. In fact, they comment in their paper how ?obvious? these principles are, and remark that when they started recommending these to designers, the designers' reactions implied that these principles were indeed obvious. However, when they asked designers at a human factors symposium for the major steps in software design, most of them did not cite most of the principles?in fact, only 2% mentioned all of them.

This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of ?design, test, measure, and redesign? being repeated as often as necessary. | So maybe they had ?obvious? merit, but were not so easy to put into practice. The Olympic Messaging System (OMS) (Gould et al., 1987) was the first reported large computer-based system to be developed using these three principles. Here a combination of techniques was used to elicit users' reactions to designs, from the earliest prototypes through to the final product. In this case, users were mainly involved in evaluating designs. The OMS is discussed further in Chapter 12.

Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Four basic activities for interaction design were introduced in Chapter 1, some of which you will have engaged in when doing Activity 9.1. These are: identifying needs and establishing requirements for the user experience, developing alternative designs that meet those requirements, building interactive versions of the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed, and evaluating what is being built throughout the process and the user experience it offers. They are fairly generic activities and can be found in other design disciplines too. For example, in architectural design (RIBA[2], 1988) basic requirements are established in a work stage called ?inception,? alternative design options are considered in a ?feasibility? stage, and ?the brief is developed through outline proposals and scheme design. During this time, prototypes may be built or perspectives may be drawn to give clients a better indication of the design being developed. Detail design specifies all components, and working drawings are produced. Finally, the job arrives on site and building commences.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Interaction design involves designing interactive products. The most sensible way for users to evaluate such designs, then, is to interact with them. This requires an interactive version of the designs to be built, but that does not mean a software version is required. There are different techniques for achieving ?interaction,? not all of which require a working piece of software. For example, paper-based prototypes are very quick and cheap to build and are very effective for identifying problems in the early stages of design, and through role-playing users can get a real sense of what it will be like to interact with the product. This aspect is also covered in Chapter 11.
Four Basic Activities of Interacti ,  | Evaluation is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design that is measured in terms of a variety of criteria including the number of errors users make using it, how appealing it is, how well it matches the requirements, and so on. Interaction design requires a high level of user involvement throughout development, and this enhances the chances of an acceptable product being delivered. In most design situations you will find a number of activities concerned with quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is ?fit-for-purpose.? Evaluation does not replace these activities, but complements and enhances them. We devote Chapters 12 to 15 to the important subject of evaluation.
